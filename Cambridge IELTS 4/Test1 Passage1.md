Adults and children are frequently confronted with statements about the alarming rate of loss of tropical rainforests. For example, one graphic illustration to which children might readily relate is the estimate that rainforests are being destroyed at a rate equivalent to one thousand football fields ever forty minutes – about the duration of a normal classroom period. In the face of the frequent and often vivid media coverage, it is likely that children will have formed ideas about rainforests – what and where they are, why they are important, what endangers them – independent of any formal tuition. It is also possible that some of these ideas will be mistaken.
成年人和孩子们总是面对着各种各样关于热带雨林消失速率的表述。比如，一个比较形象化的表述估计是：热带雨林正在以40分钟1000个足球场大小的速度消失——相当于一节普通课程的时间。面对着如此反复且生动的媒介描述，这可能给孩子们对热带雨林塑造出一个这样的现象：他们是什么，在哪儿，为什么他们很重要，什么让他们濒临灭绝，独立于任何一种形式的培训所产生的想法。很有可能，某些观点可能会被误解。

Many studies have shown that children harbor misconceptions about ‘pure’, curriculum science. These misconceptions do not remain isolated but become incorporated into a multifaceted, but organized, conceptual framework, making it and the component ideas, some of which are erroneous, more robust but also accessible to modification. These ideas may be developed by children absorbing ideas through the popular media. Sometimes this information may be erroneous. It seems schools may not be providing an opportunity for children to re-express their ideas and so have them tested and refined by teachers and their peers.
许多研究表明，孩子们都隐藏了对“纯洁”和课程中的科学的误读。这些误解没有被孤立并且演变成一个多因素的、有组织性的、概念性的框架，这使得这种理念变得有很多错误，稳固却可以时刻改进的观点。孩子们产生了这些观点可能是通过大众媒体所接触到的。有时，这些错误可能是错误的。问题可能是学校没有给孩子们机会让他们重新阐述他们的想法，因此他们要被同行或者是老师反复测试和定义。

Despite the extensive coverage in the popular media of the destruction of rainforests, little formal information is available about children’s ideas in this area. The aim of the present study is to start to provide such information, to help teachers design their educational strategies to build upon correct ideas and to displace misconceptions and to plan program to in environmental studies in their schools.
尽管大众媒体不断地对热带雨林的破坏进行报道，在这一方面孩子们自己的看法则很少有关注。目前的研究就是为了提供这些信息，以便让老师们设计好他们的教学方法去建立正确的观念，取代掉错误的理念，并在学校中开展环保教育课程。

The study surveys children’s scientific knowledge and attitudes to rainforests. Secondary school children were asked to complete a questionnaire containing five open-form questions. The most frequent responses to the first question were description which are self-evident from the term ‘rainforest’. Some children described them as damp, wet or hot. The second question concerned the geographical location of rainforests. The commonest response were continents or countries: Africa (given by 43% of children), South America (30%), Brazil (25%). Some children also gave more general locations, such as being near the Equator.
这项研究反应了孩子们的科学知识，以及他们对于雨林的态度。中学生们被要求填写一份包含有五个开放性问题的表格。第一个问题是描述他们对于短语“雨林”的理解，我们分析了最主要的描述。一些学生形容他们微湿，潮湿或者炎热。第二个问题是问雨林的地理位置。回答最多的地方主要在：非洲（43%的孩子回答），南非（30%），巴西（25%）。一些孩子同样给出了其他地点，比如靠近赤道的地区。

Responses to question three concerned the importance of rainforests. The dominant idea, raised by 64% of the pupils, was the rainforests provide animals with habitats. Fewer students responded that rainforests provide plant habitats, and even fewer mentioned the indigenous population of rainforests. More girls (70%) than boys (60%) raised the idea of rainforest as animal habitats.
第三个问题主要关注的是雨林的重要性。64%的孩子们回答的中心意思是说雨林为动物们提供了生活环境。很少有学生能提到植物生长，更少的人提到雨林的原始居民。女孩（70%）比男孩（60%）更清楚雨林是动物的栖息地。

The results of this study suggest that certain ideas predominate in the thinking of children about rainforests. Pupils’ responses indicate some misconceptions in basic scientific knowledge of rainforests’ ecosystems such as their ideas about rainforests as habitats for animals, plants and humans and the relationship between climatic change and destruction of rainforests.
研究结果显示了目前孩子们对于雨林的看法。孩子们对于雨林的生态系统在基本科学领域存在误解，比如他们对于雨林是不是动物、植物和人类的居住地以及气候变化和雨林的破坏之间的联系。

Pupils did not volunteer ideas that suggested that they appreciated the complexity of cause of rainforest destruction. In other words, they gave no indication of an appreciation of either the range of ways in which rainforests are important or the complex social, economic and political factors which drive the activities which are destroying the rainforests. One encouragement is that the results of similar studies about other environmental issues suggest that older children to acquire the ability to appreciate, value and evaluate conflicting views. Environmental education offers an arena in which these skills can be developed, which is essential for these children as future decision-makers.
孩子们并不会自愿地表达他们关于雨林毁灭的复杂原因的看法。也就是说，他们并不会表现出非常认同雨林是非常重要的观点，或者说复杂的社会、经济和政治因素导致了雨林的毁灭。有比较积极的一面是，年长一点儿的孩子会有能力评判、分析并评估不同的观点。环境教育提供了一些方法来让这些能力得到发展，这对于孩子们将来成为决策者提供了可能。
