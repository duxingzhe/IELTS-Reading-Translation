Lost for Words

失落的语言

Many minority languages are on the danger list

许多语言正在濒危名单上

In the Native American Navajo nation, which sprawls across four states in the American south-west, the native language is dying. Most of its speakers are middle-aged or elderly. Although many students take classes in Navajo, the schools are run in English. Street signs, supermarket goods and even their own newspaper are all in English. Not surprisingly, linguists doubt that any native speakers of Navajo will remain in a hundred years’ time.

在土生土长的美国Navajo地区，是覆盖了美国西南部四个周的地区，本地的语言正在逐渐消失。许多说着本地方言的人已经是中年和老年人。尽管许多学生参加Navajo的课程，但是学校却在使用英语。街道标志、超市商品甚至他们的本地报纸都是英文的。不用说，语言学家在怀疑一百年后这些Navajo母语使用者是否仍然存在。

Navajo is far from alone. Half the world’s 6,800 languages are likely to vanish within two generations – that’s one language lost every ten days. Never before has the planet’s linguistic diversity shrunk at such a pace. ‘At the moment, we are heading for about three or four languages dominating the world,’ says Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading. ‘It’s a mass extinction, and whether we will ever rebound from the loss is difficult to know.’

Navajo不是特例。6800多种语言中有近一半在一到两代人之间内消亡——也就说大概每10天消失一种语言。自人类历史上，从来没有像现在这样出现大规模的语言消失情况。“现在，我们正在面临3-4种语言统治世界的情况，”Mark Pagel说，一位在阅读大学研究进化的科学家。“这是大规模的灭绝，我们是否能挽救这种趋势尚不得而知。”


Isolation breeds linguistic diversity: as a result, the world is peppered with languages spoken by only a few people. Only 250 languages have more than a million speakers, and at least 3,000 have fewer than 2,500. It is not necessarily these small languages that are about to disappear. Navajo is considered endangered despite have 150,000 speakers. What makes a language endangered is not just the number of speakers, but how old they are. If it is spoken by children it is relatively safe. The critically endangered languages are those that are only spoken by elderly, according to Michael Krauss, director of the Alassk Native Language Center, in Frairbanks.


分隔诞生了语言的多样性：因此，世界正在接受语言被越来越少人使用的情况。只有250种语言有100万以上的人在使用，最少3000的和少于2500人。语言使用的人数并不是决定语言消亡的因素。Navajo尽管有15万人在用，但是他认为会消亡。让语言出现失传危险的不是使用的人数，而是他们的年龄分布。如果都是被孩子所使用，就是安全的。那些即将消亡的语言是因为他们总是被老人所使用，Michael Krauss说，阿拉斯加自然语言中心主任，在Frairbanks.

Why do people reject the language of their parents? It beigns with a crisis of confidence, when a small community finds itself alongside a larger, wealthier society, says Nicholas Ostler, of Britain’s Foundation for Endangered Languages, in Bath. ‘People lose faith in their culture,’ he says. ‘When the next generation reaches their teens, they might not want to be induced into the old traditions.’ 

The change is not always voluntary. Quite often, governments try to kill off a minority language by banning its use in public or discouraging its use in schools, all to promote national unity. The former US policy of running Indian reservation schools in English, for example, effectively put languages such as Navajo on the danger list. But Salikoko Mufwene, who chairs the Linguistics department at the University of Chicago, argues that the deadliest weapon is not government policy but economic globalization. ‘Native Americans have not lost pride in their language, but they have had to adapt to socio-economic pressures,’ he says, ‘They cannot refuse to speak English if most commercial activity is in English.’ But are languages worth saving? At the very least, there is a loss of data for the study of languages, both living and dead. When an unwritten and unrecorded language disappears, it is lost to science.
