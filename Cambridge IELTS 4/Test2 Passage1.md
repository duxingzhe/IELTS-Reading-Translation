Lost for Words

失落的语言

Many minority languages are on the danger list

许多语言正在濒危名单上

In the Native American Navajo nation, which sprawls across four states in the American south-west, the native language is dying. Most of its speakers are middle-aged or elderly. Although many students take classes in Navajo, the schools are run in English. Street signs, supermarket goods and even their own newspaper are all in English. Not surprisingly, linguists doubt that any native speakers of Navajo will remain in a hundred years’ time.

在土生土长的美国Navajo地区，是覆盖了美国西南部四个周的地区，本地的语言正在逐渐消失。许多说着本地方言的人已经是中年和老年人。尽管许多学生参加Navajo的课程，但是学校却在使用英语。街道标志、超市商品甚至他们的本地报纸都是英文的。不用说，语言学家在怀疑一百年后这些Navajo母语使用者是否仍然存在。

Navajo is far from alone. Half the world’s 6,800 languages are likely to vanish within two generations – that’s one language lost every ten days. Never before has the planet’s linguistic diversity shrunk at such a pace. ‘At the moment, we are heading for about three or four languages dominating the world,’ says Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading. ‘It’s a mass extinction, and whether we will ever rebound from the loss is difficult to know.’

Navajo不是特例。6800多种语言中有近一半在一到两代人之间内消亡——也就说大概每10天消失一种语言。自人类历史上，从来没有像现在这样出现大规模的语言消失情况。“现在，我们正在面临3-4种语言统治世界的情况，”Mark Pagel说，一位在阅读大学研究进化的科学家。“这是大规模的灭绝，我们是否能挽救这种趋势尚不得而知。”


Isolation breeds linguistic diversity: as a result, the world is peppered with languages spoken by only a few people. Only 250 languages have more than a million speakers, and at least 3,000 have fewer than 2,500. It is not necessarily these small languages that are about to disappear. Navajo is considered endangered despite have 150,000 speakers. What makes a language endangered is not just the number of speakers, but how old they are. If it is spoken by children it is relatively safe. The critically endangered languages are those that are only spoken by elderly, according to Michael Krauss, director of the Alassk Native Language Center, in Frairbanks.


分隔诞生了语言的多样性：因此，世界正在接受语言被越来越少人使用的情况。只有250种语言有100万以上的人在使用，最少3000的和少于2500人。语言使用的人数并不是决定语言消亡的因素。Navajo尽管有15万人在用，但是他认为会消亡。让语言出现失传危险的不是使用的人数，而是他们的年龄分布。如果都是被孩子所使用，就是安全的。那些即将消亡的语言是因为他们总是被老人所使用，Michael Krauss说，阿拉斯加自然语言中心主任，在Frairbanks.

Why do people reject the language of their parents? It begins with a crisis of confidence, when a small community finds itself alongside a larger, wealthier society, says Nicholas Ostler, of Britain’s Foundation for Endangered Languages, in Bath. ‘People lose faith in their culture,’ he says. ‘When the next generation reaches their teens, they might not want to be induced into the old traditions.’ 

为什么不和父母学习语言？这是因为信心的危机。当一种小语言发现他们和更大、富有的社区一起生活时，在巴斯的英国危险语言研究协会的尼古拉斯·奥斯特教授说，“人们对他们的文化感到失望。到了下一代，他们的青少年可能会遵守传统。”

The change is not always voluntary. Quite often, governments try to kill off a minority language by banning its use in public or discouraging its use in schools, all to promote national unity. The former US policy of running Indian reservation schools in English, for example, effectively put languages such as Navajo on the danger list. But Salikoko Mufwene, who chairs the Linguistics department at the University of Chicago, argues that the deadliest weapon is not government policy but economic globalization. ‘Native Americans have not lost pride in their language, but they have had to adapt to socio-economic pressures,’ he says, ‘They cannot refuse to speak English if most commercial activity is in English.’ But are languages worth saving? At the very least, there is a loss of data for the study of languages, both living and dead. When an unwritten and unrecorded language disappears, it is lost to science.

改变可能不是自发的。有时候，政府可能尝试消灭语言，通过限制他们在公众场合使用或者不允许他们在校园里使用，所有的原因都是为了国家的凝聚力。在印第安人居住区，之前的美国政策便是要求校园内使用英语，真是类似与这个问题，让Navajo成功的成为一门濒危的语言。但是芝加哥大学的语言系主任Salikoko Mufwene则认为，最致命的问题不是政府的政策，而是经济全球化。“本地美国人并没有对他们的语言产生失落感，但是他们必须面对严重的社会经济压力，”他说，“如果大多数社会活动使用英语，那么他们就没法拒绝使用英语。”但是语言就应该被保留吗？至少有一点，在语言研究中许多信息将会消失，无论是存活的还是灭绝的。当一种语言没有被写下或者被记录而消失，对于科学而言，也就没有了意义。

Language is also intimately bound up with culture, so it may be difficult to preserve one without the other. ‘If a person shifts from Navajo to English, they loss something,’ Mufwene says. ‘Moreover, the loss of diversity many also deprive us of different ways of looking at the world,’ says Pagel. There is mounting evidence that learning a language produces physiological changes in the brain. ‘Your brain and mine are different from the brain of someone who speaks French, for instance,’ Pagel says, and this could affect our thoughts and perceptions. ‘The patterns and connections we make among various concepts may be structured by the linguistic habits of our community.’

语言往往相伴于文化而行，所以文化不能脱离语言而存在。“如果一个人从Navajo转向英语，他会损失一些东西。”Mufwene说。“此外，语言多样性的消失对我们对于世界多角度认知是没有帮助的。”Pagel说。有越来越多的证据表明学习一门语言会对脑部产生物理性变化。“就比如说，你我的大脑和那些说法语的人是不同。”Pagel说。它会影响我们的思想和概念。“这些在不同概念之间形成的模式和连接方式可能是由我们社区的语言习惯所导致的。”

So despite linguists’ best efforts, many languages will disappear over the next century. But a growing interest in cultural identity many prevent the direst predictions from coming true. ‘The key to fostering diversity is for people to learn their ancestral tongue, as well as the dominant language,’ says Doug Whalen, founder and president of the Endangered Language Fund in New Haven Connecticut. ‘Most of these languages will not survive without a large degree of bilingualism,’ he says. In New Zealand, classes for children have slowed the erosion the language. A similar approach in Hawaii has produced about 8,000 new speakers of Polynesian languages in the past few years. In California ‘apprentice’ program have provided life support to several indigenous languages. Volunteer ‘apprentices’ pair up with one of the last living speakers of a Native American tongue to learn a traditional skill such as basket weaving, with instruction exclusively in the endangered language. After about 300 hours of training they are generally sufficiently fluent to transmit the language to the next generation. But Mufwene says that preventing a language dying out is not the same as giving it new life by using it every day. ‘Preserving a language is more like preserving fruits in a jar,’ he says.

所以尽管语言学者的努力，许多语言将会在这个世纪完全消失。但是在社区身份的提高，许多语言将会摆脱这种命运。“关键在于让人们去学习他们祖先的语言，同时学习主要语言，”Doug Whalen说，他是New Haven康乃迪克州的濒危语言组织的发起人和主席。“许多语言如果没有了大量的双语者将不会存活。”在新西兰，为孩子们提供的课程让语言的小事得到了减少。在过去的几年内，夏威夷实行了类似的计划，8000位Polynesian的语言使用者被培养出来。在加利福尼亚，“学徒”项目被用于一些原始语言。学徒项目的志愿者和当地还在生活的原始本地美国人结伴而行，一起学习传统语言和技能，比如通过已经濒危的语言的指导下来编篮子。经过300小时的学习，他们已经逐渐流利地将语言交给了下一代人。但是Mufwene说防止语言消失并不是每天使用这门语言。“保护语言就像保存罐子的苹果一样。”

However, preservation can bring a language back from the dead. There are examples of languages that survived in written form and then been revived by later generations. But a written form is essential for this, so the mere possibility of revival has led many speakers of endangered languages to develop systems of writing where none existed before.

然而，保留语言有可能让语言同样消失。有许多例子表明语言可以用书写的形式保留下来并由接下来的几代人振兴。但是必须要有书面形式，所以让还能说濒危语言的使用者创造出一种书写形式，而且这种书写形式还与其他语言的书写方式不同的情况是不太现实的。
