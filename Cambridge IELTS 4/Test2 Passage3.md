Play is A Serious Business

别笑，在玩呢

Does play help develop bigger, better brains? Bryant Furlow investigates

玩能让大脑更大更灵活吗？Bryant Furlow在研究

Playing is a serious business. Children engrossed in a make-believe world, fox cubs play-fighting or kittens teasing a ball of string aren’t just having fun. Play may look like a carefree and exuberant way to pass the time before the hard work of adulthood comes along, but there’s much more to it than that. For a start, play can even cost animals their lives. Eighty per cent of deaths among juvenile fur seals occur because playing pups fail to spot predators approaching. It is also extremely expensive in terms of energy. Playful young animals use around two or three per cent of their energy cavorting, and in children that figure can be closer to fifteen per cent. ‘Even two or three per cent is hug,’ says John Byers of Idaho University. ‘You just don’t find animals wasting energy like that,’ he adds. There must be a reason.

玩乐是一种严肃的事情。孩子们热衷于探索的世界当中，狐狸的幼崽既像玩又像打斗的场景，小猫们不停地追着线球，这可能不仅仅只是玩耍。玩可能在成年到来之前的一种无忧无虑的、生机勃勃的方法来消磨时间。一开始，玩可能会浪费动物的时间。80%的青少年海狗的死亡正是因为在玩耍的时候没有注意到捕食者的靠近。这同样需要大量的精力。会玩的年轻动物用去了大概2%或3%的能量，在幼年则可能会到15%。“甚至2%或3%都可能非常多了，”John Byers说，他是Idaho大学的教授。“你发现没有动物能像这样消耗精力。”他补充道。着一定是有原因的。

But if play is not simply a developmental hiccup, as biologists once thought, why did it evolve? The latest idea suggests that play has evolved to build big brains. In other words, playing makes you intelligent. Playfulness, it seems, is common only among mammals, although a few of the larger-brained birds also indulge. Animals at play often use unique signs – tail-wagging in dogs, for example – to indicate that activity superficially resembling adult behavior is not really in earnest. A popular explanation of play has been that if helps juveniles develop the skills they will need to hunt, mate and socialize as adults. Another has been that it allows young animals to get in shape for adult life by improving their respiratory endurance. Both these ideas have been questioned in recent years.

但是，玩乐如果不仅仅是像生物学家想象的那样，一种启发的行为，又是什么呢？最新的研究可能认为玩对大脑的变大有作用。换一种方式来说，玩乐让你更聪明。可能，玩乐可能只在动物之间比较常见，虽然一些有比较大的大脑的鸟儿也会有这种行为。动物常常使用特殊的信号——比如说，狗的尾巴相互触碰——来表明那些组合成成年行为的活动并不是非常认真的。一个对玩非常流行的理论是说他帮助青少年的动物培养有关捕猎、求偶和社会化的行为，这些行为都是成年必须得。另外便是，动物可以通过增加呼吸能力来在成年的时候塑性。这些观点在最近都疑虑重重。

Take the exercise theory. If play evolved to build muscle or as a kind of endurance training, then you would expect to see permanent benefits. But Byers points out that the benefits of increased exercise disappear rapidly after training stops, so any improvement in endurance resulting from juvenile play would be lost by adulthood. ‘If the function of play was to get into shape,’ says Byers, ‘the optimum time for playing would depend on when it was most advantageous for the young of a particular species to do so. But it doesn’t work like that.’ Across species, play tends to peak about halfway through the suckling stage and then decline.
