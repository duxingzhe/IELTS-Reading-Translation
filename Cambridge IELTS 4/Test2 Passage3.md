Play is A Serious Business

别笑，在玩呢

Does play help develop bigger, better brains? Bryant Furlow investigates

玩能让大脑更大更灵活吗？Bryant Furlow在研究

Playing is a serious business. Children engrossed in a make-believe world, fox cubs play-fighting or kittens teasing a ball of string aren’t just having fun. Play may look like a carefree and exuberant way to pass the time before the hard work of adulthood comes along, but there’s much more to it than that. For a start, play can even cost animals their lives. Eighty per cent of deaths among juvenile fur seals occur because playing pups fail to spot predators approaching. It is also extremely expensive in terms of energy. Playful young animals use around two or three per cent of their energy cavorting, and in children that figure can be closer to fifteen per cent. ‘Even two or three per cent is hug,’ says John Byers of Idaho University. ‘You just don’t find animals wasting energy like that,’ he adds. There must be a reason.

玩乐是一种严肃的事情。孩子们热衷于探索的世界当中，狐狸的幼崽既像玩又像打斗的场景，小猫们不停地追着线球，这可能不仅仅只是玩耍。玩可能在成年到来之前的一种无忧无虑的、生机勃勃的方法来消磨时间。一开始，玩可能会浪费动物的时间。80%的青少年海狗的死亡正是因为在玩耍的时候没有注意到捕食者的靠近。这同样需要大量的精力。会玩的年轻动物用去了大概2%或3%的能量，在幼年则可能会到15%。“甚至2%或3%都可能非常多了，”John Byers说，他是Idaho大学的教授。“你发现没有动物能像这样消耗精力。”他补充道。着一定是有原因的。

But if play is not simply a developmental hiccup, as biologists once thought, why did it evolve? The latest idea suggests that play has evolved to build big brains. In other words, playing makes you intelligent. Playfulness, it seems, is common only among mammals, although a few of the larger-brained birds also indulge. Animals at play often use unique signs – tail-wagging in dogs, for example – to indicate that activity superficially resembling adult behavior is not really in earnest. A popular explanation of play has been that if helps juveniles develop the skills they will need to hunt, mate and socialize as adults. Another has been that it allows young animals to get in shape for adult life by improving their respiratory endurance. Both these ideas have been questioned in recent years.

但是，玩乐如果不仅仅是像生物学家想象的那样，一种启发的行为，又是什么呢？最新的研究可能认为玩对大脑的变大有作用。换一种方式来说，玩乐让你更聪明。可能，玩乐可能只在动物之间比较常见，虽然一些有比较大的大脑的鸟儿也会有这种行为。动物常常使用特殊的信号——比如说，狗的尾巴相互触碰——来表明那些组合成成年行为的活动并不是非常认真的。一个对玩非常流行的理论是说他帮助青少年的动物培养有关捕猎、求偶和社会化的行为，这些行为都是成年必须得。另外便是，动物可以通过增加呼吸能力来在成年的时候塑性。这些观点在最近都疑虑重重。

Take the exercise theory. If play evolved to build muscle or as a kind of endurance training, then you would expect to see permanent benefits. But Byers points out that the benefits of increased exercise disappear rapidly after training stops, so any improvement in endurance resulting from juvenile play would be lost by adulthood. ‘If the function of play was to get into shape,’ says Byers, ‘the optimum time for playing would depend on when it was most advantageous for the young of a particular species to do so. But it doesn’t work like that.’ Across species, play tends to peak about halfway through the suckling stage and then decline.

思考一下运动方面的理论。如果玩会促进增长肌肉或者是一种长期训练，你可能会期待会看到持久的好处。但是Byers指出，持续锻炼的益处在训练结束后迅速消失，所以在青少年玩乐中所获得到的任何进步都会在成年人时期消失。“如果玩的功能是保持身形，”Byers说，“最好玩耍的时间应该取决于一个特定的物种在最好的时期去玩乐。但是似乎他并不是如此运作的。”不同物种之间，玩似乎在半路上便会达到顶峰，然后进入平稳期，最后下降。

Then there’s the skills-training hypothesis. At first glance, playing animals do appear to be practicing the complex maneuvers they will need in adulthood. But a closer inspection reveals this interpretation as too simplistic. In one study, behavioral ecologist Tim Caro, from the University of California, looked at the predatory play of kittens and their predatory behavior when they reached adulthood. He found that the way cats played had no significant effect on their hunting prowess in later life.

接着，有一种称之为技巧训练的假设。在先前看来，玩的动物确实实在模拟他们在成年以后所需要的复杂行为。但是更仔细地观察却表明这样的推测太过肤浅。在一个研究中，行为学家Tim Caro，来自加利福尼亚大学的教授，观察了小猫的捕食行为和他们在成年后的捕食行为。他发现幼儿时期的猫玩乐的方式对他们成年后的行为没有多少影响。

Earlier this year, Sergio Pellis of Lethbridge University, Canada, reported that there is a strong positive link between brain size and playfulness among mammals in general. Comparing measurements for fifteen orders of mammal, he and his team found larger brains (for a given body size) are linked to greater playfulness. The converse was also found to be true. Robert Barton of Durham University believes that, because large brains are more sensitive to developmental stimuli than smeller brains, they require more play to help mould them for adulthood. ‘I concluded it’s to do with learning, and with the importance of environmental data to the brain during development,’ he says.

今年早些时候，加拿大Lethbridge大学的Sergo Pellis说从总体而言大脑的大小和哺乳动物的游戏之间有比较强的联系。相比于十五种哺乳动物团体的测量，他和他的团队发现更大的大脑（和身体相比）和更快乐的玩耍成正比。相反情况同样如此。Durham大学的Robert Barton相信因为更大的大脑可以对刺激更敏感，这比小一点儿的大脑是有优势的，这需要在小的时候充分玩耍。“我将它和学习联系在一起，而在大脑正在发育的时候环境信息的重要性不可忽略。”他说。

According to Byers, the timing of the playful stage in young animals provides an important clue to what’s going on. If you plot the amount of time a juvenile devotes to play each day over the course of its development, you discover a pattern typically associated with a ‘sensitive period’ – a brief development window during which the brain can actually be modified in ways that are not possible earlier or later in life. Think of relative ease with which young children – but not infants or adults – absorb language. Other researchers have found that play in cats, rats and mice is at its most intense just as this ‘window of opportunity’ reaches its peak.

根据Byers所说，在年轻动物上的游戏阶段时间的开始提供了非常重要线索来说明发生了什么。如果你将一个青年每天玩游戏的时间总量连成一条线，并与自己成长的时间相对比，你会发现有一个“特别时期”，这个时期与一个模型息息相关——一个短暂的窗口期，这个时间段内大脑可以有巨大的改变，而在此之前和之后都不会再出现。想象一下年轻的孩子，不是婴儿或者成年人，学习新的语言。其他的研究也表明猫、老鼠在某一个阶段玩的比较多，就是因为窗口期达到了顶峰。

‘People have not paid enough attention to the amount of the brain activated by play,’ says Marc Bekoff from Colorado University. Bekoff studied coyote pups at play and found that the kind of behavior involved was markedly more variable and unpredictable than that of adults. Such behavior activates many different parts of the brain, he reasons. Bekoff likens it to a behavioral kaleidoscope, with animals at play jumping rapidly between activities. ‘They use behavior from a lot of different contexts – predation, aggression, reproduction,’ he says. ‘Their developing brain is getting all sorts of stimulation.’

“对于大脑发育与玩乐之间的关系，人们并没有太多的关注。”来自Colorado大学的Marc Bekoff说。Bekoff研究一种北美洲的小狼幼崽在学习中的过程后，发现他们学习的行为比他们在成年所接触到的更加难以捉摸和预测。这些行为激发了脑部许多不同的区域。Bekoff将这些比作行为的万花筒，特别是当动物们在行为中循环跳跃的时候。“他们的行为来自于不同的环境——捕猎、进攻和繁殖，”他说，“他们大脑的发育便会接受各种各样的刺激。”

Not only is more of the brain involved in play than was suspected, but it also seems to activate higher cognitive processes. ‘There’s enormous cognitive involvement in play,’ says Bekoff. He points out that play often involves complex assessments of playmates, ideas of reciprocity and the use of specialized signals and rules. He believes that play creates a brain that has greater behavioral flexibility and improved potential for learning later in life. The idea is backed up by the work of Stephen Siviy of Gettysburg College. Siviy studied how bouts of play affected the brain’s levels of a particular chemical associated with the stimulation and growth of nerve cells. He was surprised by the extent of the activation. ‘Play just lights everything up,’ he says. By allowing link-ups between brain areas that might not normally communicate with each other, play may enhance creativity.

大脑的发育不仅怀疑和玩有联系，还认为玩可以激发高级认知过程。“很多认知过程需要玩的参与，”Bekoff说。他指出玩通常有许多玩乐同伴的评价，互相作用的想法和特殊信号和规则的运用。他相信玩使得大脑能有更好的运动灵活性并在以后的学习中能有更好的潜力。Gettysburg大学的Stephen Siviy的研究支持了这些观点。Siviy研究了回合制较量如何提高大脑有关刺激和神经细胞生长的化学元素的分泌。他被激活的程度感到惊讶。“玩乐就好像提高了所有的事情，”他说。通过联系大脑那些不会被沟通所激发的区域，玩可以提高创造力。

What might further experimentation suggest about the way children are raised in many societies today? We already know that rat pups denied the chance to play grow smaller brain components and fail to develop the ability to apply social rules when they interact with their peers. With schooling beginning earlier and becoming increasingly exam-orientated, play is likely to get even less of a look-in. Who knows what the result of that will be?
更多来自现代生活的孩子的研究能说明什么？我们已经知道了，幼鼠因为缺乏玩乐会让大脑变得更小、当他们和他的同伴沟通时对社会秩序的认知变差。当上学的时间变得越来越早，并变得以考试为中心，玩似乎更加被忽视。谁知道结果会是什么？
