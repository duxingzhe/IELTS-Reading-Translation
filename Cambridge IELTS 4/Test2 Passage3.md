Play is A Serious Business

别笑，在玩呢

Does play help develop bigger, better brains? Bryant Furlow investigates

玩能让大脑更大更灵活吗？Bryant Furlow在研究

Playing is a serious business. Children engrossed in a make-believe world, fox cubs play-fighting or kittens teasing a ball of string aren’t just having fun. Play may look like a carefree and exuberant way to pass the time before the hard work of adulthood comes along, but there’s much more to it than that. For a start, play can even cost animals their lives. Eighty per cent of deaths among juvenile fur seals occur because playing pups fail to spot predators approaching. It is also extremely expensive in terms of energy. Playful young animals use around two or three per cent of their energy cavorting, and in children that figure can be closer to fifteen per cent. ‘Even two or three per cent is hug,’ says John Byers of Idaho University. ‘You just don’t find animals wasting energy like that,’ he adds. There must be a reason.

玩乐是一种严肃的事情。孩子们热衷于探索的世界当中，狐狸的幼崽既像玩又像打斗的场景，小猫们不停地追着线球，这可能不仅仅只是玩耍。玩可能在成年到来之前的一种无忧无虑的、生机勃勃的方法来消磨时间。一开始，玩可能会浪费动物的时间。80%的青少年海狗的死亡正是因为在玩耍的时候没有注意到捕食者的靠近。这同样需要大量的精力。会玩的年轻动物用去了大概2%或3%的能量，在幼年则可能会到15%。“甚至2%或3%都可能非常多了，”John Byers说，他是Idaho大学的教授。“你发现没有动物能像这样消耗精力。”他补充道。着一定是有原因的。

But if play is not simply a developmental hiccup, as biologists once thought, why did it evolve? The latest idea suggests that play has evolved to build big brains. In other words, playing makes you intelligent. Playfulness, it seems, is common only among mammals, although a few of the larger-brained birds also indulge. Animals at play often use unique signs – tail-wagging in dogs, for example – to indicate that activity superficially resembling adult behavior is not really in earnest. A popular explanation of play has been that if helps juveniles develop the skills they will need to hunt, mate and socialize as adults. Another has been that it allows young animals to get in shape for adult life by improving their respiratory endurance. Both these ideas have been questioned in recent years.
