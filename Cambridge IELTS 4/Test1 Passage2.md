What Do Whales Feel?

鲸鱼的感觉如何？

An examination of the functioning of the senses in cetaceans, the group of mammals comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises

鲸类之间的感官功能测试，在哺乳类中的鲸鱼、海豚之间比较。

Some of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals take for granted are either reduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water. For example, it appears from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell. Baleen species, on the other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not known whether are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved and migrated to the top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may have been nearly all sacrificed. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste buds, the nerves serving these have degenerated or are rudimentary.

陆地上的哺乳动物的某些感官功能在水生哺乳动物中会逐步丧失甚至退化。例如，锯齿状的动物无法呼吸，这导致了头部结构的改变。另一方面，有鲸须的动物会有一些相似的构造，但是却不知道是否有其对应的功能。可能已经非常明确的是，由于呼吸口被移动到头部的顶端，嗅觉的神经传导已经被完全退化。同样的，尽管部分鲸类有味蕾，但是这些器官的神经都已经逐步退化或者消失。

The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but this view is probably mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark on their animal’s responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and free-ranging cetacean individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members of the same subgroup) appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to maintain order within a group, and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual in most species. The area around the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and captive animals often object strongly to being touched there.

触觉同样被说成是很微弱的，但是这个观点可能是被误解了。被俘虏的和小型鲸鱼的训练者都对鲸鱼的接触和捆绑的放映感到十分惊讶，所有物种的俘虏和自由游动的鲸类个体（尤其是成年的和刚生下来的，或者是同一个子群的成员）会更加频繁地接触。这些接触会保持在一个团队里，而拍击和敲打是许多物种互相之间友情传递的一种方式。呼吸口之间往往非常敏感，而圈养起来的动物往往对这种接触相对敏感一些。

The sense of vision is developed to different degrees in different species. Baleen species studied at close quarters underwater – specifically a grey whale calf in captivity for a way, and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales studied and filmed off Argentina and Hawaii – have obviously tracked objects with vision underwater, and they can apparently see moderately well both in water and in air. However, the position of the eyes so restricts the field of vision in baleen whales that they probably do not have stereoscopic vision.

视觉在不同物种之间的能力是不同的。有鲸须的物种一般生活在四分之一的浅水面——尤其是一个灰色的鲸鱼幼崽用某种方式放置在有光线的地方，自由放养的鲸鱼以及座头鲸一般在阿根廷和夏威夷被发现——也同样发现在水下是有视觉的，他们在水中和空气中同样可以能看到东西。然而，眼睛的位置太过于固定，以至于座头鲸的视野有限，没有空间视觉。

On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and porpoises suggests that they stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in freshwater dolphins, which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests that what vision they have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose dolphin has extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches and tracks airborne flying fish, it can apparently see fairly well through the air-water interface was well. And although preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their in-air vision is poor, the accuracy with which dolphins leap high to take small fish out of a trainer’s hand provides anecdotal evidence to the contrary.

另一方面，大多数鲸鱼和海豚的眼睛位置表明他们的空间视野主要是前方和后方。潜水鲸鱼的眼睛位置，在人类游在他的身边或者在上边喂他时，表明他们的视觉是可以在空间上察觉前后方的。相比而言，宽吻海豚在水中有非常明锐的视觉。通过判断他看物体的方式和追踪飞鱼的轨迹，他们明显的感觉得到空气和水之间的分界线。尽管之前的实验证据表明他们的空中视觉非常差劲，但是鲸鱼能够准确的从训练员的手上拿走食物表明却提出了相反的观点。

Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have deteriorated, and vision in water appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than compensated for by cetaceans’ well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal, although they vary in the range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using echolocation. Large baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited in their repertoire. Notable exceptions are the nearby song-like choruses of bowhead whales in summer and the complex, haunting utterances or the humpback whales. Toothed species in general employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a wider variety of sounds, than baleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more complicated sounds are clearly communicative, although what role they may play in the social life and ‘culture’ of cetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation that of solid science.

尽管味觉和嗅觉都已经退化，水中的视觉也变得无法确定，但是这些不利因素都因为听力的增强而得到补偿。许多物种都是高分贝的，尽管他们能发出一个大范围的声音，而且许多食物的发现都是靠回声来处理的。大须鲸主要通过低频次声音并且他们的技术比较缺乏。有些情况下会比较特殊，发出一些歌唱声，如而弓头鲸会在夏天发出合唱声或者是驼背鲸则会在捕猎的时候发出声音。有牙齿的鲸类一般有独特的声谱，并且会发出一系列的声音，比须鲸要广（尽管抹香鲸很明显能发出一系列单调的敲击声，或者是其他什么的。）。有一些比较复杂的声音则可能是交际类的，尽管他们对社交生活的作用和鲸类“文化”在野生动物科学中仍然需要更多的了解和掌握。
