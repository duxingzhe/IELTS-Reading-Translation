Visual Symbols and the blind
视觉符号与盲人

Part 1
From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than iteral representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside the circle. I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle nots, Whilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually no motion lies in his popular figures until about 1877.

在最近的研究中，越来越多的证据表明，盲人可以明白提纲的使用从多个角度来描述物体的结构以及其他空间表面。但是图画远比文字表达要复杂。这些事实深深吸引了我，当一个我正在研究的盲人决定用自己的方法来表示一个轮子在转动。为了表达出这种运动方法，她在圆里面弄了一些曲线在边上。我被彻底震惊了。运动的线条，比如现在他所用的这个，可以说是说明史上的一个非常伟大的发明。确实的，正如艺术家Dvaid Kunzle说的那样，Whilhelm Bush，一位引领19世纪的潮流的卡通漫画家，使用了一种非常视觉画的效果来展示他的知名角色的动画效果。这个方法一直用到1877年。

When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.
