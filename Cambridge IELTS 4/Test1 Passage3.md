Visual Symbols and the blind

视觉符号与盲人

Part 1
From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than iteral representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside the circle. I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle nots, Whilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually no motion lies in his popular figures until about 1877.

第一部分

在最近的研究中，越来越多的证据表明，盲人可以明白提纲的使用从多个角度来描述物体的结构以及其他空间表面。但是图画远比文字表达要复杂。这些事实深深吸引了我，当一个我正在研究的盲人决定用自己的方法来表示一个轮子在转动。为了表达出这种运动方法，她在圆里面弄了一些曲线在边上。我被彻底震惊了。运动的线条，比如现在他所用的这个，可以说是说明史上的一个非常伟大的发明。确实的，正如艺术家Dvaid Kunzle说的那样，Whilhelm Bush，一位引领19世纪的潮流的卡通漫画家，使用了一种非常视觉画的效果来展示他的知名角色的动画效果。这个方法一直用到1877年。

When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.

当我问及其他一些盲人的学习如何画轮子运动轨迹的方法时，一种特别聪明的表述方法总是在反复出现：几个物体显示轮子被表述成曲线。当问到这些曲线的含义时，他们都说这是表示运动的形象描述。大多数的规则都说这样的物体来描述运动实在太普遍了。但是为什么不用破碎的线或者是波浪线呢，或者是其他的线呢？答案似乎不是很明显。因此我决定不同的线是否能表示出运动的状态，或者他们是否有特殊而方法。更主要的是，我想发现盲人和正常人之间在表达运动的过程中试用的线条是否类似。

To search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of five different wheels, depicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extend beyond the perimeter to the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels and assign of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spinning steadily, jerking or braking. My control group of eighteen sighted undergraduates from the University of Toronto.

为了找到这些问题的答案，我花了五种不同的轮子，用的都是上升的线，使用了曲线，弯的，波浪线，点线和将线圈在轮子上的。接着，我开始询问18个盲人志愿者去感受轮子，并感受他们的运动状态：摇晃、旋转的快慢，稳定、颠簸程度、和制动情况。我的控制组是18个正常视力的多伦多大学本科生。

All but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most guessed that the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the wavy spokes, they thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent spokes were taken as a sign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes extending beyond the wheel’s perimeter signified that the wheel had its brakes on and that dashed spokes indicated the wheel was spinning quickly.

所有的盲人都将不同的轮子分类成不同的属性。许多人猜测曲线表示的轮子说明它运转稳定；波浪线表示轮子在摇晃；弯曲的轮子表示在颠簸。那种将线圈挂在轮子上的图像表示轮子正在制动，而点线则说明旋转速度非常快。

In addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for the blind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely higher than that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind, the task I gave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not only figured out meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came up with the same meaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.

另外，正常人的描述和盲人的描述跟每一个例子都是差不多的。更重要的是，正常人之间的共识和盲人之间的程度也是一样的。因为运动的东西对于盲人而言可能不太熟悉，我还让他们进行一些问题的求解。然而很明显，盲人不仅分辨出了运动线条的意义，同时他们分辨的频率和正常人没有多少区别。

Part 2
We have found that the blind understand other kinds of visual metaphors as well. One blind drew a picture of a child inside a heart – choosing that symbol, she said, to show that love surrounded the child. With Chang Hong Liu, a doctoral student from China, I have begun exploring how well blind people understand the symbolism behind shapes such as hearts that do not directly represent their meaning.

我已经发现盲人理解其他可视化的标记。一个盲人画了一个图片，一个孩子被一颗心所包围——据他描述，选择的图形能够代表爱在他的周围。通过刘洪昌（音），这位来自中国的博士，我开始研究盲人是如何理解这种类似于心形具有抽象含义的图片的，而不是那种直接表示出意义的图片。

We gave a list of twenty pairs of words to sighted subjects and asked them pick from each pair the term that best related to a square. For example, we asked: What goes with soft? A circle or a square? Which shape goes with hard?

我们给了20对词汇给正常人，接着希望他们将每一个短语和最符合正方形里面的描述的内容放在一起。比如，我们问到：什么和柔软联系在一起？圆圈还是正方形？什么样的正方形和困难联系在一起？

All our subjects deemed the circle soft and the square hard. A full 94% ascribed happy to the circle, instead of sad. But other pairs revealed less agreement: 79% matched fast to slow and weak to strong, respectively. And only 51% linked deep to circle and shallow to square. (See Fig. 2.) When we tested four totally blind volunteers using the same list, we found that their choices closely resembled those make by the sighted subjects. One man, who had been blind since birth, scored extremely well. He made only one match differing from the consensus, assigning ‘far’ to square and ‘near’ to circle. In fact, only a small majority of sighted subjects - 53% - had paired far and near to the opposite partners. Thus, we concluded that the blind interpret abstract shapes as sighted people do.

我们所有的实验对象，都说圆形代表柔软而方形代表困难。94%的人将快乐和圆形联系在一起，而不是忧伤。但是其他的则不是那么的统一：79%的人将快和慢，弱和强分别和圆和方块联系在一起。只有51%的人将深与圆，吞和方联系在一起。当我们测试了四个完全失明的志愿者的时候，他们面对同一张表所做的选择和视力正常的人的选择是一样的。一个人，自从他出身以来便失明，成绩一样好。他只和其他人有一处不同，将远和方，近和圆联系在一起。事实上，只有一小部分的正常视力（53%）才会将远和近的搭配与其他人区别开来。因此我们得出结论，盲人分析抽象物体的能力和常人一样。
