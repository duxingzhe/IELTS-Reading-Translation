Visual Symbols and the blind

视觉符号与盲人

Part 1
From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to describe the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than iteral representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside the circle. I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle nots, Whilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonist, used virtually no motion lies in his popular figures until about 1877.

在最近的研究中，越来越多的证据表明，盲人可以明白提纲的使用从多个角度来描述物体的结构以及其他空间表面。但是图画远比文字表达要复杂。这些事实深深吸引了我，当一个我正在研究的盲人决定用自己的方法来表示一个轮子在转动。为了表达出这种运动方法，她在圆里面弄了一些曲线在边上。我被彻底震惊了。运动的线条，比如现在他所用的这个，可以说是说明史上的一个非常伟大的发明。确实的，正如艺术家Dvaid Kunzle说的那样，Whilhelm Bush，一位引领19世纪的潮流的卡通漫画家，使用了一种非常视觉画的效果来展示他的知名角色的动画效果。这个方法一直用到1877年。

When I asked several other blind study subjects to draw a spinning wheel, one particularly clever rendition appeared repeatedly: several subjects showed the wheel’s spokes as curved lines. When asked about these curves, they all described them as metaphorical ways of suggesting motion. Majority rule would argue that this device somehow indicated motion very well. But was it a better indicator than, say, broken or wavy lines – or any other kind of line, for that matter? The answer was not clear. So I decided to test whether various lines of motion were apt ways of showing movement or if they were merely idiosyncratic marks. Moreover, I wanted to discover whether there were differences in how the blind and the sighted interpreted lines of motion.

当我问及其他一些盲人的学习如何画轮子运动轨迹的方法时，一种特别聪明的表述方法总是在反复出现：几个物体显示轮子被表述成曲线。当问到这些曲线的含义时，他们都说这是表示运动的形象描述。大多数的规则都说这样的物体来描述运动实在太普遍了。但是为什么不用破碎的线或者是波浪线呢，或者是其他的线呢？答案似乎不是很明显。因此我决定不同的线是否能表示出运动的状态，或者他们是否有特殊而方法。更主要的是，我想发现盲人和正常人之间在表达运动的过程中试用的线条是否类似。

To search out these answers, I created raised-line drawings of five different wheels, depicting spokes with lines that curved, bent, waved, dashed and extend beyond the perimeter to the wheel. I then asked eighteen blind volunteers to feel the wheels and assign of the following motions to each wheel: wobbling, spinning fast, spinning steadily, jerking or braking. My control group of eighteen sighted undergraduates from the University of Toronto.

All but one of the blind subjects assigned distinctive motions to each wheel. Most guessed that the curved spokes indicated that the wheel was spinning steadily; the wavy spokes, they thought, suggested that the wheel was wobbling; and the bent spokes were taken as a sign that the wheel was jerking. Subjects assumed that spokes extending beyond the wheel’s perimeter signified that the wheel had its brakes on and that dashed spokes indicated the wheel was spinning quickly.

In addition, the favoured description for the sighted was the favoured description for the blind in every instance. What is more, the consensus among the sighted was barely higher than that among the blind. Because motion devices are unfamiliar to the blind, the task I gave them involved some problem solving. Evidently, however, the blind not only figured out meanings for each line of motion, but as a group they generally came up with the same meaning at least as frequently as did sighted subjects.
