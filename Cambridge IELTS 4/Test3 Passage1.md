Micro-Enterprise Credit for Street Youth

为街头青年提供微型企业的信用

‘I am from a large, poor family and for many years we have done without breakfast. Ever since I joined the Street Kids International program I have been able to buy my family sugar and buns for breakfast. I have also bought myself decent second-hand clothes and shoes.’

我来自一个许多年都没有早饭的大的贫困家庭。自从我加入了街头青年国际计划当中，我开始为我的家人购买糖和小面包作为早餐。同时我为自己购买了几件过时的二手衣服和鞋子。

‘We’ve had business experience. Now I’m confident to expand what we’ve been doing. I’ve learnt cash management, and the way of keeping money so we save for reinvestment. Now business is a part of our lives. As well, we didn’t know each other before – now we’ve made new friends.’

“我们有生意经验。现在我有信心扩大我们现在做的事情。我学会了财务管理，管理自己的资金，这样我们可以节省下来继续投资。现在生意成为了我们生活的一部分。同时，我们之前从未了解他人——现在我们成为了朋友。”

Introduction

Although small-scale business training and credit programs have become more common throughout the world, relatively little attention has been paid to the need to direct such opportunities to young people. Even less attention has been paid to children living on the street or in difficult circumstances.
