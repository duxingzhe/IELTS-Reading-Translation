Micro-Enterprise Credit for Street Youth

为街头青年提供微型企业的信用

‘I am from a large, poor family and for many years we have done without breakfast. Ever since I joined the Street Kids International program I have been able to buy my family sugar and buns for breakfast. I have also bought myself decent second-hand clothes and shoes.’

Doreen Soko

我来自一个许多年都没有早饭的大的贫困家庭。自从我加入了街头青年国际计划当中，我开始为我的家人购买糖和小面包作为早餐。同时我为自己购买了几件过时的二手衣服和鞋子。

‘We’ve had business experience. Now I’m confident to expand what we’ve been doing. I’ve learnt cash management, and the way of keeping money so we save for reinvestment. Now business is a part of our lives. As well, we didn’t know each other before – now we’ve made new friends.’

“我们有生意经验。现在我有信心扩大我们现在做的事情。我学会了财务管理，管理自己的资金，这样我们可以节省下来继续投资。现在生意成为了我们生活的一部分。同时，我们之前从未了解他人——现在我们成为了朋友。”

Introduction

导言

Although small-scale business training and credit programs have become more common throughout the world, relatively little attention has been paid to the need to direct such opportunities to young people. Even less attention has been paid to children living on the street or in difficult circumstances.

尽管小型企业培训和信用课程在世界中越来越流行，然而提供给年轻人的机会却相当少。甚至给那些街头上的或者是困难处境的孩子的课程。

Over the past nine years, Street Kids International (S.K.I) has been working with partner organizations in Africa, Latin America and India to support the economic lives of street children. The purpose of this paper is to share some of the lessons S.K.I. and our partners have learned.

在过去的九年里，街头孩子国际已经在非洲、拉丁美洲和印度开展了合作组织来推动流浪在街头孩子们的经济生活。这篇文章就是来分享街头孩子国际的方法以及我们的伙伴所学得的经验。

Background
背景

Typically, children do not end up on the streets due to a single cause, but to a combination of factors: a dearth of adequately funded schools, the demand for income at home, family breakdown and violence. The street may be attractive to children as a place to find adventurous play and money. However, it is also a place where some children are exposed, with little or no protection, to exploitative employment, urban crime, and abuse.
传统意义而言，孩子不会因为单一的原因而流浪在街头，而是多种因素的综合作用：原来学校的裁撤，家里收入的需求，家庭破灭和家庭暴力。街道就成了孩子获取冒险性娱乐和钱财的地方。然而，这同样是这些孩子暴露于没有保护的地方，参与剥削的劳动、城市犯罪和被虐待。

Children who work on the streets are generally involved in unskilled, labor-intensive tasks which require long hours, such as shining shoes, carrying goods, guarding or washing cars, and informal trading. Some may also earn income through begging, or through theft and other illegal activities. At the same time, there are street children who take pride in supporting themselves and their families and who often enjoy their work. Many children may choose entrepreneurship because it allows them a degree of independence, is less exploitative than many forms of paid employment, and is flexible enough to allow them to participate in other activities such as education and domestic tasks.

那些流落在街头的男孩通常都是没有那么多的技能，而那些劳动密集型的工作则需要长工作时间，比如抛光鞋子，搬运物品，保安或者是洗车，或者是不正式的贸易。有些则可能会通过乞讨，甚至是偷窃或者是其他的非法手段来获取钱财。同时，街头青年通常会以能够养活他们自己和他们的家庭而感到自豪，而且会喜欢他们的工作。许多孩子会选择企业因为它能让青年有效的独立出去，并且能够比其他方法更少剥削，并且更有灵活性，让他们能够参加教育或者是本地的事情。

Street Business Partnerships

街头经济伙伴计划

S.K.I. has worked with partner organizations in Latin America, Africa and India to develop innovative opportunities for street children to earn income.

SKI在拉丁美洲、非洲和印度与当地的合作组织为街头青年提供帮助来获得收入。

* The S.K.I. Bicycle Counter Service first started in the Sudan. Participants in this enterprise were supplied with bicycles, which they used to deliver parcels and messsages, and which they were required to pay for gradually from their wages. A similar program was taken up in Bangalore, India.

SKI自行车看管服务是第一个在苏丹建立起来的项目。这个企业的参与者提供自行车，这样它们能运送包裹或者是信件，并从他们的工资中抽取一部分作为押金。在印度班加罗尔地区，一个类似的计划同样被建立起来。

* Another successful project, The Shoe Shine Collective, was a partnership program with Y.W.C.A. in the Dominican Republic. In this project, participants were lent money to purchase shoe shine boxes. They were alson given a safe place to store their equipment, and facilities for individual savings plan.

* 另外一个成功的项目，鞋子抛光项目，是在多米尼克共和国与青年合作组织的伙伴项目。在这个计划当中，参与者可以借到部分的钱来买到鞋子抛光用品。他们同样会提供一个安全的地方来放置他们的用具，并能帮助他们建立省钱计划。

* The Youth Skills Enterprise Initiative in Zambia is joint program with the Red Cross Society and the Y.W.C.A street youths are supported to start their own small business through business training, life skills training and access to credit.

* 在赞比亚的青年技能企业启动计划是一项和当地红十字会一起创建的项目，街头青年通过企业培训、生活技能培训和获取信用来让他们创业。

Lessons learned

经验教训

The following lessons have emerged from the programs that S.K.I and partner organisations have created.

以下便是从街头男孩启动计划和合作组织发展的项目中得到的经验和教训。

* Being an entrepreneur is not for everyone, nor for every street child. Ideally, potential participants will have been involved in the organisation's programs for at least six months, and trust and relationship-building will have already been established.

不是所有的人的都能做企业家，同样不适合所有的街头男孩。理想的情况下，潜在的参与者至少要参与组织者的项目至少六个月，这样信任和伙伴关系才能建立起来。

* The involvement of the participants has been essential to the development of relevant programs. When children have had a major role in determining procedures, they are more likely to abide by and enforce them.

参与者的互动是开发相关项目的必备因素。当孩子们在生产生活中有了主导的地位，他们将会更加依赖这些项目，并让项目更有活力。

* It is critical for all loans to be linked to training programs that include the development of basic business and life skills.

所有项目的投资都要包含基本的商业活动和生活能力，这样才是最重要的。

* There are tremendous advantages to involving parents or guardians in the program, where such relationship exist. Home visits allow staff the opportunity to know where the participants live, and to understand more about each individual's situation.

让父母和监管者参与到项目中来非常有必要，这能让关系一直保持下去。家访让员工有机会知道参与者在哪里生活，并明白每个参与者的具体情况。

* Small loan are provided initialy for purchasing fixed assets such as bicyles, shoe shine kits and basic building materials for a market stall. As the entrepreneurs gain experience, the enterprises can be gradually expanded and consideration can be given to increasing loan amounts. The loan amounts in S.K.I programs have generally ranged from US$30-$100.

小额贷款起初是用于购买固定资产，比如自行车、鞋子抛光用具和基本货架的建筑材料。当企业家们逐渐获得了经验，企业得到发展就可以获得多一些贷款额度。S.K.I项目的贷款额度主要在30-100美元。

* All S.K.I programs have charged interest on the loans, primarily to get the entrepreneurs used to the concept of paying interest on borrowed money. Generally the rates have been modest (lower than bank rates).

所有的SKI项目贷款都是需要付利息的，基本上就是让企业家通过借款支付利息的概念来维持。通常情况下利率都很低（低于银行利率）。

Conclusion

结论

There is a need to recognise the importance of access to credit for impoverished young people seeking to fulfil economic needs. The provision of small loans to support the entrepreneurial dreams and ambitions of youth can be an effective means to help them change their lives. However, we believe that credit must be extended in association with other types of support that help participants develop critical life skills as well as productive business.

让贫穷的青年寻找到某种机会去满足自己的经济需求是非常重要的。提供小额贷款来帮助青年人支持他们的企业家梦想和雄心壮志是一个非常有效的方法来帮助他们改变生活。但是，我们相信机会必须要扩展一下，以便提供其他形式的帮助来让参与者获得更重要的生存技能和富有成效的生意。
