Micro-Enterprise Credit for Street Youth

为街头青年提供微型企业的信用

‘I am from a large, poor family and for many years we have done without breakfast. Ever since I joined the Street Kids International program I have been able to buy my family sugar and buns for breakfast. I have also bought myself decent second-hand clothes and shoes.’

Doreen Soko

我来自一个许多年都没有早饭的大的贫困家庭。自从我加入了街头青年国际计划当中，我开始为我的家人购买糖和小面包作为早餐。同时我为自己购买了几件过时的二手衣服和鞋子。

‘We’ve had business experience. Now I’m confident to expand what we’ve been doing. I’ve learnt cash management, and the way of keeping money so we save for reinvestment. Now business is a part of our lives. As well, we didn’t know each other before – now we’ve made new friends.’

“我们有生意经验。现在我有信心扩大我们现在做的事情。我学会了财务管理，管理自己的资金，这样我们可以节省下来继续投资。现在生意成为了我们生活的一部分。同时，我们之前从未了解他人——现在我们成为了朋友。”

Introduction

导言

Although small-scale business training and credit programs have become more common throughout the world, relatively little attention has been paid to the need to direct such opportunities to young people. Even less attention has been paid to children living on the street or in difficult circumstances.

尽管小型企业培训和信用课程在世界中越来越流行，然而提供给年轻人的机会却相当少。甚至给那些街头上的或者是困难处境的孩子的课程。

Over the past nine years, Street Kids International (S.K.I) has been working with partner organizations in Africa, Latin America and India to support the economic lives of street children. The purpose of this paper is to share some of the lessons S.K.I. and our partners have learned.

在过去的九年里，街头孩子国际已经在非洲、拉丁美洲和印度开展了合作组织来推动流浪在街头孩子们的经济生活。这篇文章就是来分享街头孩子国际的方法以及我们的伙伴所学得的经验。

Background
背景

Typically, children do not end up on the streets due to a single cause, but to a combination of factors: a dearth of adequately funded schools, the demand for income at home, family breakdown and violence. The street may be attractive to children as a place to find adventurous play and money. However, it is also a place where some children are exposed, with little or no protection, to exploitative employment, urban crime, and abuse.
传统意义而言，孩子不会因为单一的原因而流浪在街头，而是多种因素的综合作用：原来学校的裁撤，家里收入的需求，家庭破灭和家庭暴力。街道就成了孩子获取冒险性娱乐和钱财的地方。然而，这同样是这些孩子暴露于没有保护的地方，参与剥削的劳动、城市犯罪和被虐待。

Children who work on the streets are generally involved in unskilled, labor-intensive tasks which require long hours, such as shining shoes, carrying goods, guarding or washing cars, and informal trading. Some may also earn income through begging, or through theft and other illegal activities. At the same time, there are street children who take pride in supporting themselves and their families and who often enjoy their work. Many children may choose entrepreneurship because it allows them a degree of independence, is less exploitative than many forms of paid employment, and is flexible enough to allow them to participate in other activities such as education and domestic tasks.

那些流落在街头的男孩通常都是没有那么多的技能，而那些劳动密集型的工作则需要长工作时间，比如抛光鞋子，搬运物品，保安或者是洗车，或者是不正式的贸易。有些则可能会通过乞讨，甚至是偷窃或者是其他的非法手段来获取钱财。同时，街头青年通常会以能够养活他们自己和他们的家庭而感到自豪，而且会喜欢他们的工作。许多孩子会选择企业因为它能让青年有效的独立出去，并且能够比其他方法更少剥削，并且更有灵活性，让他们能够参加教育或者是本地的事情。
