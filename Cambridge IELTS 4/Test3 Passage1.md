Micro-Enterprise Credit for Street Youth

为街头青年提供微型企业的信用

‘I am from a large, poor family and for many years we have done without breakfast. Ever since I joined the Street Kids International program I have been able to buy my family sugar and buns for breakfast. I have also bought myself decent second-hand clothes and shoes.’

我来自一个许多年都没有早饭的大的贫困家庭。自从我加入了街头青年国际计划当中，我开始为我的家人购买糖和小面包作为早餐。同时我为自己购买了几件过时的二手衣服和鞋子。

‘We’ve had business experience. Now I’m confident to expand what we’ve been doing. I’ve learnt cash management, and the way of keeping money so we save for reinvestment. Now business is a part of our lives. As well, we didn’t know each other before – now we’ve made new friends.’
