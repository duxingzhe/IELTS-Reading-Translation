如何更高更快

Limits to Human Sporting Performance Are Not Yet in Sight

人类的运动上限仍然在探索当中

Since the early years of the twentieth century, when the International Athletic Federation began keeping records, there has been a steady improvement in how fast athletes run,how high they jump and how far they are able to hurl massive objects, themselves included, through space. For the so-called power events — that require a relatively brief,explosive release of energy, like the 100-metre sprint and the long jump — times and distances have improved ten to twenty percent. In the endurance events the results have been more dramatic. At the 1908 Olympics, John Hayes of the U.S.team ran a marathon in a time of 2:55:18. In 1999, Morocco's Khalid Khannouchi set a new world record of 2:05:42, almost thirty percent faster.

20世纪早期以来，当国际运动联合会开始记录世界纪录以来，运动员们已经在跑步、跳高、丢出质量中的物品等项目中有了许多的进步。有些被称作是需要力量型运动——需要瞬间爆发性的力量，比如100米跑步和长跳——已经在时间和距离上提高了10%到20%。而那些持久性的运动则更有明显的进步。在1908年的奥运会上，美国队约翰·亚斯在马拉松上跑了2:55:18。在1999年，摩洛哥队员Khalid Khannouchi则创造了新的世界纪录2:05:42，基本上比前者快30%。

No one theory can explain improvements in performance, but the most important factor has been genetics. ‘The athlete must choose his parents carefully,’ says Jesus Dapena, a sports scientist at Indiana University, invoking an oft-cited adage. Over the past century, the composition of the human gene pool has not changed appreciably, but with increasing global participation in athletics — and greater rewards to tempt athletes — it is more likely that individuals possessing the unique complement of genes for athletic perfomance can be identified early. ‘Was there someone like [sprinter] Michael Johnson in the 1920s?’ Dapena asks. ‘I’m sure that there was, but his talent was probably never realized.’
