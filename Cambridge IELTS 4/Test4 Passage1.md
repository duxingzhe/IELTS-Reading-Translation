How much higher? How much faster?

如何更高更快

Limits to Human Sporting Performance Are Not Yet in Sight

人类的运动上限仍然在探索当中

Since the early years of the twentieth century, when the International Athletic Federation began keeping records, there has been a steady improvement in how fast athletes run,how high they jump and how far they are able to hurl massive objects, themselves included, through space. For the so-called power events — that require a relatively brief,explosive release of energy, like the 100-metre sprint and the long jump — times and distances have improved ten to twenty percent. In the endurance events the results have been more dramatic. At the 1908 Olympics, John Hayes of the U.S.team ran a marathon in a time of 2:55:18. In 1999, Morocco's Khalid Khannouchi set a new world record of 2:05:42, almost thirty percent faster.

20世纪早期以来，当国际运动联合会开始记录世界纪录以来，运动员们已经在跑步、跳高、丢出质量中的物品等项目中有了许多的进步。有些被称作是需要力量型运动——需要瞬间爆发性的力量，比如100米跑步和长跳——已经在时间和距离上提高了10%到20%。而那些持久性的运动则更有明显的进步。在1908年的奥运会上，美国队约翰·亚斯在马拉松上跑了2:55:18。在1999年，摩洛哥队员Khalid Khannouchi则创造了新的世界纪录2:05:42，基本上比前者快30%。

No one theory can explain improvements in performance, but the most important factor has been genetics. ‘The athlete must choose his parents carefully,’ says Jesus Dapena, a sports scientist at Indiana University, invoking an oft-cited adage. Over the past century, the composition of the human gene pool has not changed appreciably, but with increasing global participation in athletics — and greater rewards to tempt athletes — it is more likely that individuals possessing the unique complement of genes for athletic perfomance can be identified early. ‘Was there someone like [sprinter] Michael Johnson in the 1920s?’ Dapena asks. ‘I’m sure that there was, but his talent was probably never realized.’

目前没有理论依据能解释在运动表现上的进步，但是最有可能的原因可能是基因。“运动员可能需要有良好的出身”，印第安纳大学的一位运动专家Jesus Dapena说。他从一句言语中得到启示。在过去的几个世纪里，人类的基因并没有发生多大变化，但是运动员的数量在全球范围内都有增加——也有更好的奖励方法来奖励业余运动员——这就让那些有良好运动基因的个人在更小的年龄中脱颖而出。“在20世纪20年代，有没有人跟迈克尔·约翰逊那样的跳高运动员呢？”Dapena问道，“我想是有的，但是他的才华却没有被发现。”

Identifying genetically talented individuals is only the first step. Michael Yessis, an emeritus professor of Sports Science at California State University at Fullerton, maintains that ‘genetics only determines about one third of what an athlete can do. But with the right training we can go much further with that one third than we’ve been going.’ Yessis believes that U.S. runners, despite their impressive achievements, are ‘running on their genetics’. By applying more scientific methods, ‘they’re going to go much faster’. These methods include strength training that duplicates what they are doing in their running events as well as plyometrics, a technique pioneered in the former Soviet Union.

发现有天赋的运动员只不过是第一步。迈克尔 Yessis是一位退休加利福尼亚州立大学的运动科学的教授，现居富尔顿。他说基因因素只能决定运动员三分之一的因素。但是如果有了更好的训练方法，我们可以做到比三分之一更多的事情。Yessis相信美国跑步运动员在基因上有天赋，使得他们有非常好的成绩。通过更为科学的方法，“他们能做得更好”。这些方法包括在跑步活动和肌肉增强训练的时候提升他们的强度的训练。这是一种曾被苏联人使用的前沿科技。

Whereas most exercises are designed to build up strength or endurance, plyometrics focuses on increasing power — the rate at which an athlete can expend energy. When a sprinter runs, Yessis explains, her foot stays in contact with the ground for just under a tenth of a second, half of which is devoted to landing and the other half to pushing off.Plyometric exercises help athletes make the best use of this brief interval.

许多测试都是注重强调强度和耐力，肌肉增强训练主要关注增强力量——运动员如何快速释放力量。Yessis解释道，冲刺运动员在跑步的时候，他的脚接触地面的时间只有一秒，脚的一半在地上另一半则开始冲刺。肌肉增强训练帮助运动员充分利用好这一个短暂的间隙。
