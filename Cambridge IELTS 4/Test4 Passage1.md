How much higher? How much faster?

如何更高更快

Limits to Human Sporting Performance Are Not Yet in Sight

人类的运动上限仍然在探索当中

Since the early years of the twentieth century, when the International Athletic Federation began keeping records, there has been a steady improvement in how fast athletes run,how high they jump and how far they are able to hurl massive objects, themselves included, through space. For the so-called power events — that require a relatively brief,explosive release of energy, like the 100-metre sprint and the long jump — times and distances have improved ten to twenty percent. In the endurance events the results have been more dramatic. At the 1908 Olympics, John Hayes of the U.S.team ran a marathon in a time of 2:55:18. In 1999, Morocco's Khalid Khannouchi set a new world record of 2:05:42, almost thirty percent faster.

20世纪早期以来，当国际运动联合会开始记录世界纪录以来，运动员们已经在跑步、跳高、丢出质量中的物品等项目中有了许多的进步。有些被称作是需要力量型运动——需要瞬间爆发性的力量，比如100米跑步和长跳——已经在时间和距离上提高了10%到20%。而那些持久性的运动则更有明显的进步。在1908年的奥运会上，美国队约翰·亚斯在马拉松上跑了2:55:18。在1999年，摩洛哥队员Khalid Khannouchi则创造了新的世界纪录2:05:42，基本上比前者快30%。

No one theory can explain improvements in performance, but the most important factor has been genetics. ‘The athlete must choose his parents carefully,’ says Jesus Dapena, a sports scientist at Indiana University, invoking an oft-cited adage. Over the past century, the composition of the human gene pool has not changed appreciably, but with increasing global participation in athletics — and greater rewards to tempt athletes — it is more likely that individuals possessing the unique complement of genes for athletic perfomance can be identified early. ‘Was there someone like [sprinter] Michael Johnson in the 1920s?’ Dapena asks. ‘I’m sure that there was, but his talent was probably never realized.’

目前没有理论依据能解释在运动表现上的进步，但是最有可能的原因可能是基因。“运动员可能需要有良好的出身”，印第安纳大学的一位运动专家Jesus Dapena说。他从一句言语中得到启示。在过去的几个世纪里，人类的基因并没有发生多大变化，但是运动员的数量在全球范围内都有增加——也有更好的奖励方法来奖励业余运动员——这就让那些有良好运动基因的个人在更小的年龄中脱颖而出。“在20世纪20年代，有没有人跟迈克尔·约翰逊那样的跳高运动员呢？”Dapena问道，“我想是有的，但是他的才华却没有被发现。”

Identifying genetically talented individuals is only the first step. Michael Yessis, an emeritus professor of Sports Science at California State University at Fullerton, maintains that ‘genetics only determines about one third of what an athlete can do. But with the right training we can go much further with that one third than we’ve been going.’ Yessis believes that U.S. runners, despite their impressive achievements, are ‘running on their genetics’. By applying more scientific methods, ‘they’re going to go much faster’. These methods include strength training that duplicates what they are doing in their running events as well as plyometrics, a technique pioneered in the former Soviet Union.

发现有天赋的运动员只不过是第一步。迈克尔 Yessis是一位退休加利福尼亚州立大学的运动科学的教授，现居富尔顿。他说基因因素只能决定运动员三分之一的因素。但是如果有了更好的训练方法，我们可以做到比三分之一更多的事情。Yessis相信美国跑步运动员在基因上有天赋，使得他们有非常好的成绩。通过更为科学的方法，“他们能做得更好”。这些方法包括在跑步活动和肌肉增强训练的时候提升他们的强度的训练。这是一种曾被苏联人使用的前沿科技。

Whereas most exercises are designed to build up strength or endurance, plyometrics focuses on increasing power — the rate at which an athlete can expend energy. When a sprinter runs, Yessis explains, her foot stays in contact with the ground for just under a tenth of a second, half of which is devoted to landing and the other half to pushing off.Plyometric exercises help athletes make the best use of this brief interval.

许多测试都是注重强调强度和耐力，肌肉增强训练主要关注增强力量——运动员如何快速释放力量。Yessis解释道，冲刺运动员在跑步的时候，他的脚接触地面的时间只有一秒，脚的一半在地上另一半则开始冲刺。肌肉增强训练帮助运动员充分利用好这一个短暂的间隙。

Nutrition is another area that sports trainers have failed to address adequately. 'Many athletes are not getting the best nutrition, even through supplements,' Yessis insists. Each activity has its own nutritional needs. Few coaches, for instance, understand how deficiencies in trace minerals can lead to injuries.

营养是运动训练者另一个所忽视的领域。“许多运动员并没有获得最好的营养，就算是充分的补充也不能获得最好的营养。”Yessis坚称。每一项活动都有他自己的专门的营养需求。就比如说，很少有教练知道如何关心那些会导致损伤的微量元素。

Focused training will also play a role in enabling records to be broken. "If we applied the Russian training model to some of the outstanding runners we have in this country," Yessis asserts, "they would be breaking records left and right". He will not predict by how much, however: "Exactly what the limits are its hard to say, but there will be increases even if only by hundredths of a second, as long as our training continues to improve."

把精力放在训练上同样能在打破记录上发挥重要作用。“如果我们把俄罗斯训练一些优秀运动员的训练方法用在我们身上，”Yessis教授说，“我们能更加轻松地突破记录。”他并没有预测能有多少，然而：“能进步多少不好说，但是进步百分之一秒都是好的，只要我们的训练方法持续改进。”

One of the most important new methodologies is biomechanics, the study of the body in motion. A biomechanics films an athlete in action and then digitizes her performance,recording the motion of every joint and limb in three dimensions. By applying Newton’s laws to these motions, ‘we can say that this athlete’s run is not fast enough; that this one is not using his arms strongly enough during take-off,’ says Dapena, who uses these methods to help high jumpers. To date, however, biomechanics has made only a small difference to athletic performance.

其中一种最重要的新科技是生物力学，在运动中的时候，身体的变化的研究。生物力学录像记录了一位运动员的动作，并用数字化方式呈现她的运动过程，记录每一个关节的运动状态并用三维方式呈现。运用牛顿的三大定律，“我们可以说这个运动员跑的仍然不够快；这一位运动员在起跑的时候还没有用尽臂力。”Dapena说，他将这些方法用于帮助跳高运动员。但是到目前为止，生物力学对于运动员的进步微乎其微。

Revolutionary ideas still come from the athletes themselves. For example, during the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, a relatively unknown high jumper named Dick Fosbury won the gold by going over the bar backwards, in complete contradiction of all the received high-jumping wisdom, a move instantly dubbed the Fosbury flop. Fosbury himself did not know what he was doing. That understanding took the later analysis of biomechanics specialists, who put their minds to comprehending something that was too complex and unorthodox ever to have been invented through their own mathematical simulations. Fosbury also required another element that lies behind many improvements in athletic performance: an innovation in athletic equipment. In Fosbury’s case, it was the cushions that jumpers land on. Traditionally, high jumpers would land in pits filled with sawdust. But by Fosbury’s time, sawdust pits had been replaced by soft foam cushions, ideal for flopping.

革命性的观点依然是来自于运动员本身。比如，在1968年的墨西哥奥运会，一个相当不出名的跳高运动员Dick Fosbury通过后背跳的方式获得了金牌，这完全与之前的跳高方法不同。于是被立刻命名为背越式跳高。Fosbury自己并不知道他在做啥。之后为了分析其潜在的道理，生物力学专家开始用数学模型来分析其背后的复杂而超乎平常的道理。。Fosbury同样要求满足其他要素，这些要素依赖于许多运动员表现的进步之处：对运动设备的创新。在Fosbury的案例中，垫子是跳高者落地的位置。通常情况下，跳高运动员都是落在铺满木屑的地方。但是自Fosbury开始，木屑被软棉垫代替，对于背越式跳高非常有帮助。

In the end, most people who examination human performance are humbled by the resourcefulness of athletes and the powers of the human body. ‘Once you study athletics,you learn that it’s a vexingly complex issue,’ says John S. Raglin, a sports psychologist at Indiana University. ‘Core performance is not a simple of mundane thing of higher, faster,longer. So many variables enter into the equation, and our understanding in many cases is fundamental. We’ve got a long way to go.’ For the foreseeable future, records will be made to be broken.

最后，许多研究人类运动的科学家都对运动员所获得的资源和人体内在潜力感到震惊。“一旦你开始学习运动学，你会发现这是一个非常复杂的问题。”在印第安纳大学的运动心理学教授Jhon S. Raglin说。“核心的表现不只是平时我们说的更快、更高、更强。因此是有很多因素在互相作用，我们目前的很多认知也只是基础的。我们有很长的路要走。”在可预见的未来，记录有可能还是会被打破。
