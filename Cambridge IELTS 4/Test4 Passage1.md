How Much Higher? How Much Faster?

Limits to Human Sporting Performance Are Not Yet in Sight

Since the early years of the twentieth century, when the International Athletic Federa-tion began keeping records, there has been a steady improvement in how fast athletes run,how high they jump and how far they are able to hurl massive objects, themselves included, through space. For the so-called power events — that require a relatively brief,explosive release of energy, like the 100-metre sprint and the long jump — times and ​distances have improved ten to twenty percent. In the endurance events the results have ​been more dramatic. At the 1908 Olympics, John Hayes of the U.S.team ran a marathon​ in a time of 2:55:18. In 1999, Morocco's Khalid Khannouchi set a new world record of 2:05:42, almost thirty percent faster.
