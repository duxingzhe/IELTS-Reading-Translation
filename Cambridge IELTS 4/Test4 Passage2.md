The Nature and Aims of Archaeology

考古学的本质和目的

Archaeology is partly the discovery of the treasures of the past, partly the careful work of the scientific analyst, partly the exercise of the creative imagination. It is toiling in the sun on an excavation in the Middle-East, it is working with living Inuit in the snows of Alaska, and it is investigating the sewers of Roman Britain. But it is also the painstaking task of interpretation, so that we come to understand what these things mean for the human story. And it is the conservation of the world's cultural heritage against looting and careless harm.

考古学一部分是为了发现过去的宝藏，一方面是科学研究的细致分析，还有就是创造性的想象力。它在中东炽热的骄阳下艰难进行，它在阿拉斯加的冰天雪地与当地纽因特人的生活中寻找，它同时也在罗马统治时期的英国的下水道里。但是他也是一门艰苦难熬的翻译过程，所以我们必须明白他们对于人类历史的意义。它是与世界文化遗迹的对话，而不是掠夺和破坏。

Archaeology, then, is both a physical activity out in the field, and an intellectual pursuit in the study or laboratory. That is part of its great attraction. The rich mixture of danger and detective work has also made it the perfect vehicle for fiction writers and film-makers, from Agatha Christie with Murder in Mesopotamia to Stephen Spielberg with Indiana Jones. However far from reality such portrayals are, they capture the essential truth that archaeology is an exciting quest — the quest for knowledge about ourselves and our past.

接着，考古学主要是在一块区域的物理活动和在实验室或者是研究室里的智力活动。这一部分是因为他需要专注力。危险性和细致入微的调查工作让考古学成为了科幻小说家和电影制片人灵感的完美源泉。从Agatha Christie的《美索不达米亚谋杀案》到史蒂芬·斯皮尔伯格的《印地安纳・琼斯》系列。但是真实的考古工作却没有电影那么精彩，考古学最精彩的是发觉真相——从中发现我们的自身和过去。

But how does archaeology relate to disciplines such as anthropology and history, that are also concerned with the human story? Is archaeology itself a science? And what are the responsibilities of the archaeologist in today’s world?

但是考古学家如何拥有像人类学和历史学那样的教条呢？也就是说，是否能像人类学和历史学那样专注人类的传说呢？考古学能称之为科学吗？在当今社会，考古学的责任又是什么。
