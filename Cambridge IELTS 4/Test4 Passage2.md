The Nature and Aims of Archaeology

考古学的本质和目的

Archaeology is partly the discovery of the treasures of the past, partly the careful work of the scientific analyst, partly the exercise of the creative imagination. It is toiling in the sun on an excavation in the Middle-East, it is working with living Inuit in the snows of Alaska, and it is investigating the sewers of Roman Britain. But it is also the painstaking task of interpretation, so that we come to understand what these things mean for the human story. And it is the conservation of the world's cultural heritage against looting and careless harm.

考古学一部分是为了发现过去的宝藏，一方面是科学研究的细致分析，还有就是创造性的想象力。它在中东炽热的骄阳下艰难进行，它在阿拉斯加的冰天雪地与当地纽因特人的生活中寻找，它同时也在罗马统治时期的英国的下水道里。但是他也是一门艰苦难熬的翻译过程，所以我们必须明白他们对于人类历史的意义。它是与世界文化遗迹的对话，而不是掠夺和破坏。

Archaeology, then, is both a physical activity out in the field, and an intellectual pursuit in the study or laboratory. That is part of its great attraction. The rich mixture of danger and detective work has also made it the perfect vehicle for fiction writers and film-makers, from Agatha Christie with Murder in Mesopotamia to Stephen Spielberg with Indiana Jones. However far from reality such portrayals are, they capture the essential truth that archaeology is an exciting quest — the quest for knowledge about ourselves and our past.

接着，考古学主要是在一块区域的物理活动和在实验室或者是研究室里的智力活动。这一部分是因为他需要专注力。危险性和细致入微的调查工作让考古学成为了科幻小说家和电影制片人灵感的完美源泉。从Agatha Christie的《美索不达米亚谋杀案》到史蒂芬·斯皮尔伯格的《印地安纳・琼斯》系列。但是真实的考古工作却没有电影那么精彩，考古学最精彩的是发觉真相——从中发现我们的自身和过去。

But how does archaeology relate to disciplines such as anthropology and history, that are also concerned with the human story? Is archaeology itself a science? And what are the responsibilities of the archaeologist in today’s world?

但是考古学家如何拥有像人类学和历史学那样的教条呢？也就是说，是否能像人类学和历史学那样专注人类的传说呢？考古学能称之为科学吗？在当今社会，考古学的责任又是什么。

Anthropology, at its broadest, is the study of humanity — our physical characteristics as animals and our unique non-biological characteristics that we call culture. Culture in this sense includes what the anthropologist, Edward Tylor, summarised in 1871 as ‘knowledge, belief, art, morals, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society’. Anthropologists also use the term ‘culture’ in a more restricted sense when they refer to the ‘culture’ of a particular society, meaning the non-biological characteristics unique to that society, which distinguish it from other societies. Anthropology is thus a broad discipline — so broad that it is generally broken down into three smaller disciplines: physical anthropology, cultural anthropology and archaeology.

从广义上讲，考古学学习的是人性——我们作为动物的那一部分和我们独特的生物特性，我们称之为文化。文化在这个语境下包括了人类学家Edward Tylor在1871总结的内涵，它是人作为一个社会一员所有的认识，信仰，艺术，道德，习俗和其他能力和习惯。人类学家同样使用了文化一词，它更多地适用于一个更为严谨的场景，他们将它与特定的社会联系在一起，来表明非常独特的非生物特性社区，和其他社区所有的不同之处。人类学因此有一个广泛的戒律——以至于最后分化成三大块：物理人类学、文化人类学和考古学。

Physical anthropology, or biological anthropology as it is also called, concerns the study of human biological or physical characteristics and how they evolved. Cultural anthropology — or social anthropology — analyses human culture and society. Two of its branches are ethnography (the study at first hand of individual living cultures) and ethnology (which sets out to compare cultures using ethnographic evidence to derive general principles about human society). 

人类个体学或者叫生物个体学，正如他所说的那样，关注人类生物或者物理特征，以及它们是如何进化的——或者叫社会个体学——分析人类文化和社会。他有两个分支，人种论（研究个体生活结构的第一手资料）和人种学（用人种学的证据得到普世价值来比较人类社会文化）。

Archaeology is the ‘past tense of culture anthropology’. Whereas cultural anthropologists will often base their conclusions on the experience of living within contemporary communities, archaeologists study past societies primarily through their material remains— the buildings, tools and other artefacts that constitutes what is known as the material culture left over from former societies.

考古学研究着文化的过去式。文化人类学家将经常基于他们在同时代的社区的生活经验来得出研究结论，考古学通常通过遗留的文字材料来研究社会的主要内容——建筑、工具和其他在之前社会中遗留下来的工艺品。

Nevertheless, one of the most important tasks for the archaeologist today is to know how to interpret material culture in human terms. How were those pots used? Why are some dwellings round and others square? Here the methods of archaeology and ethno-graphy overlap. Archaeologists in recent decades have developed ‘ethnography’, where,like ethnographers, they live among contemporary communities, but with the specific purpose of learning how such societies use material culture — how they make their tools and weapons, why they build their settlements where they do, and so on. Moreover,archaeology has an active role to play in the field of conservation. Heritage studies con-stitutes a developing field, where it is realized that the world’s cultural heritage is a diminishing resource which holds different meanings for different people.

无论如何，时至今日，考古学目前所要解决的一个重要问题便是如何用现代人的语言将当年物质文明进行解读。这些点是什么意思？有些住所是圆的，而另外一些是方的？这些理论都是考古学和古人物学重合的部分。
