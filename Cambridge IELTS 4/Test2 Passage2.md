Alternative Medicine in Australia

澳大利亚的中药

The first students to study alternative medicine at university level in Australia began their four-year, full-time course at the University of Technology, Sydney, in early 1994. Their course covered, among other therapies, acupuncture. The theory they learnt is based on the traditional Chinese explanation of this ancient healing art: that it can regulate the flow of ‘Qi’ or energy through pathways in the body. This course reflects how far some alternative therapies have come in their struggle for acceptance by the medical establishment.

澳大利亚第一批在学校学习中医的学生开始了他们在澳大利亚科技大学为期四年的全日制课程。悉尼在1994年早期便覆盖了这些教育方法。课程包括例如针灸的其他治疗方法。这些课程起源于中国传统中医的治疗方法：他被气的流动所控制，或者说是在身体里能量的流动的轨迹所决定。这个课程反应了如今的医学界对于中医治疗理论的部分认可和接受。

Australia has been unusual in the Western world in having a very conservative attitude to natural or alternative therapies, according to Dr. Paul Laver, a lecturer in Public Health at the University of Sydney. ‘We’ve had a tradition of doctors being fairly powerful and I guess they are pretty loath to allow any pretenders to their position to come into it.’ In many other industrialized countries, orthodox and alternative medicine have worked ‘hand in glove’ for years. In Europe, only orthodox doctors can prescribe herbal medicine. In Germany, plant remedies account for 10% of the national turnover of pharmaceuticals. Americans made more visits to alternative therapists than to orthodox doctors in 1990, and each year they spend about $US 12 billion on therapies that have not been scientifically tested.

澳大利亚和西方世界有所不同，他们对于自然或者是中医疗法的态度非常温和，保罗博士说。他是悉尼大学公共卫生专业的讲师。“我们有非常专业医生的传统，我相信他们也非常欢迎让更多的人加入。”在其他的工业化国家，旧式和中医药已经合作多年。在欧洲，只有旧式药的医生能开这些药方。在德国，植物治疗法占到了国家整个医药市场的12%。美国在1990年的时候，更多的消费者喜欢使用中医治疗而不是旧式医药，他们每年花在还没有经过科学测试过的治疗方法上的费用是120亿美元。

Disenchantment with orthodox medicine has seen the popularity of alternative therapies in Australia climb steadily during the past 20 years. In a 1984 national health survey, 1.9% of people said they had contacted a chiropractor, naturopath, osteopath, acupuncturist or herbalist in the two weeks prior to the survey. By 1990, this figure had risen to 2.6% of the population. The 550,000 consultations with alternative therapies reported in the 1990 survey represented about an eighth of the total number of consultations with medically qualified personnel covered by the survey, according to Dr Laver and colleagues writing in the Australian Journal of Public Health in 1993. ‘A better educated and less accepting public has become disillusioned with the experts in general, and increasingly skeptical about science and empirically based knowledge,’ they said. ‘The high standing of professionals, including doctors, has been eroded as a consequence.’

在过去的20年里，澳大利亚民众在接受中医治疗的时候意识到传统医药的局限性，并越来越明显。在1984年的一次健康调查中，1.9%的人们说他们在两个星期内已经接受了脊椎指压法、自然疗法、整骨疗法、针灸疗法或者是草药疗法。在1990年，数据攀升到2.6%。在1990年的调查中，550,000声称接受过中医治疗的受访者占到了所有医学治疗调查的八分之一，这是Laver博士和同伴们在1993年澳大利亚公共健康杂志上发表的研究报告。“良好的教育和较低的社会承认让大众里面的专家得以清醒。”他们说，“因此，大部分对于教授的标准，比如医生，正在慢慢被腐蚀。”

Rather than resisting or criticizing this trend, increasing numbers of Australian doctors, particularly younger ones, are forming group practices with alternative therapists or taking courses themselves, particularly in acupuncture and herbalism. Part of the incentive was financial, Dr Laver said. ‘The bottom line is that most general practitioners are business people. If they see potential clientele going elsewhere, they might want to be able to offer a similar service.’

与其对抗这种潮流或者批评这种潮流，越来越多的医生，特别是年轻一代的医生开始组成团体学习中医治疗或者自己学习相关技术，特别是针灸和草药。其中部分的考虑可能是经济上的考虑，Laver博士说：“这是因为我们都是职业者，是经济为导向的。如果他们看到潜在的客户都愿意接受某种疗法，他们可能会考虑提供相似的服务。”

In 1993, Dr Laver and his colleagues published a survey of 289 Sydney people who attended eight alternative therapists’ practices in Sydney. These practices offered a wide range of alternative therapies from 25 therapists. Those surveyed had experienced chronic illnesses, for which orthodox medicine had been able to provide little relief. They commented that they liked the holistic approach of their alternative therapists and the friendly, concerned and detailed attention they had received. The cold, impersonal manner of orthodox doctors featured in the survey. An increasing exodus from their clinics, coupled with this and a number of other relevant surveys carried out in Australia, all pointing to orthodox doctors’ inadequacies, have led mainstream doctors themselves to begin to admit they could learn from the personal style of alternative therapists.

1993年，Laver博士和他的同事们对悉尼进行过八种中医治疗的289位悉尼居民进行了调查，并发布调查情况。这些治疗方法是从25位治疗医生中提供的非常广的治疗方法。这些治疗的居民经历了许多慢性疾病，而旧式医药则稍微减缓了痛苦。他们说他们接受了非常友好、善良、细致的治疗，而且在治疗过程中他们中医医师对他们很热心。然而却说他们那些旧式医药师则很冷漠。很多病人从旧式医药师那儿离开，而这种情况在澳大利亚其他相关调查中也有出现，同时都指出了以往医生们的不合适之处。这让许多主流医生开始认同他们可以在中医医生中的个人风格中学到什么。Patrick Store博士，皇家大学的主席改进对病人的态度，并多向病人提供意见来从中医医生中争夺病人。

According to the Australian Journal of Public Health, 18% of patients visiting alternative therapists do so because they suffer from musculo-skeletal complaints; 12% suffer from digestive problem, which is only 1% more than those suffering from emotional problems. Those suffering from respiratory complaints represent 7% of their patients, and candida sufferers represents an equal percentage. Headache sufferers and those complaining of general ill health represent 6% and 5% of patients respectively, and a further 4% see therapists for general health maintenance.

根据澳大利亚公共健康杂志的报道，18%的病人之所以选择中医治疗是因为他们经受着肌肉和骨骼的痛苦；12%的病人则有消化系统疾病，而只有1%的病人有情绪方面的问题。7%的病人则会有呼吸系统问题，念珠菌感染则由同样多的人群。6%和5%的病人则分别有头疼和其他方面的普通疾病，4%则需要治疗者进行普通的健康维护。

The survey suggested that complementary medicine is probably a better term than alternative medicine. Alternative medicine appears to be an adjunct, sought in time of disenchantment when conventional medicine seems not to offer the answer.

这说明补充的药物可能对中药治疗有更好的疗程。中药更主要的是一种辅助药物，我们要明白，这说明当传统药物没有能力提供方法的时候，我们可以考虑中药。
