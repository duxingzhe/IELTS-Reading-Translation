Alternative Medicine in Australia

澳大利亚的中药

The first students to study alternative medicine at university level in Australia began their four-year, full-time course at the University of Technology, Sydney, in early 1994. Their course covered, among other therapies, acupuncture. The theory they learnt is based on the traditional Chinese explanation of this ancient healing art: that it can regulate the flow of ‘Qi’ or energy through pathways in the body. This course reflects how far some alternative therapies have come in their struggle for acceptance by the medical establishment.

澳大利亚第一批在学校学习中医的学生开始了他们在澳大利亚科技大学为期四年的全日制课程。悉尼在1994年早期便覆盖了这些教育方法。课程包括例如针灸的其他治疗方法。这些课程起源于中国传统中医的治疗方法：他被气的流动所控制，或者说是在身体里能量的流动的轨迹所决定。这个课程反应了如今的医学界对于中医治疗理论的部分认可和接受。

Australia has been unusual in the Western world in having a very conservative attitude to natural or alternative therapies, according to Dr. Paul Laver, a lecturer in Public Health at the University of Sydney. ‘We’ve had a tradition of doctors being fairly powerful and I guess they are pretty loath to allow any pretenders to their position to come into it.’ In many other industrialized countries, orthodox and alternative medicine have worked ‘hand in glove’ for years. In Europe, only orthodox doctors can prescribe herbal medicine. In Germany, plant remedies account for 10% of the national turnover of pharmaceuticals. Americans made more visits to alternative therapists than to orthodox doctors in 1990, and each year they spend about $US 12 billion on therapies that have not been scientifically tested.

澳大利亚和西方世界有所不同，他们对于自然或者是中医疗法的态度非常温和，保罗博士说。他是悉尼大学公共卫生专业的讲师。“我们有非常专业医生的传统，我相信他们也非常欢迎让更多的人加入。”在其他的工业化国家，旧式和中医药已经合作多年。在欧洲，只有旧式药的医生能开这些药方。在德国，植物治疗法占到了国家整个医药市场的12%。美国在1990年的时候，更多的消费者喜欢使用中医治疗而不是旧式医药，他们每年花在还没有经过科学测试过的治疗方法上的费用是120亿美元。

Disenchantment with orthodox medicine has seen the popularity of alternative therapies in Australia climb steadily during the past 20 years. In a 1984 national health survey, 1.9% of people said they had contacted a chiropractor, naturopath, osteopath, acupuncturist or herbalist in the two weeks prior to the survey. By 1990, this figure had risen to 2.6% of the population. The 550,000 consultations with alternative therapies reported in the 1990 survey represented about an eighth of the total number of consultations with medically qualified personnel covered by the survey, according to Dr Laver and colleagues writing in the Australian Journal of Public Health in 1993. ‘A better educated and less accepting public has become disillusioned with the experts in general, and increasingly skeptical about science and empirically based knowledge,’ they said. ‘The high standing of professionals, including doctors, has been eroded as a consequence.’
