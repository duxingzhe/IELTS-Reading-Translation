Volcanoes - earth-shattering news

火山-吸引世界的消息

When Mount Pinatubo suddenly erupted on 9 June 1991, the power of volcanoes past and present again hit the headlines.

当皮纳图博火山突然之间在1991年6月9日喷发的时候，火山带来的巨大威力就时不时地登上报纸头版头条。

Volcanoes are the ultimate earth-moving machinery. A violent eruption can blow the top few kilometres off a mountain, scatter fine ash practically all over over the globe and hurl rock fragments into the stratoshpere to darken the skies a continent away.

火山是地球运动的最强表现。一次强烈的喷发可以让火焰冲到地表以上千米外的高空，扩散的火山灰喷射到几千米之外，那些石头碎片抛向了平流层使得陆地的天空灰蒙蒙一片。

But the classic eruption - cone-shaped mountain, big bang, mushroom cloud and surges of molten lava - is only a tiny part of a global story. Vulcanism, the name given to volcanic process, really has shaped the world. Eurption have rifted continents, raised mountain chains, constructed islands and shaped the topography of the earth. The entire ocean floor has a basement of volcanic basalt.

但是普通的爆发——圆锥体的高山、大爆炸、蘑菇云和剧烈涌出液体岩浆——只不过是世界故事的一部分而已。岩石火成论者，将大自然的形成归功于火山运动的理论，确实造就了大自然的形态。喷发提升了陆地，产生了山脉，创造了岛屿，并形成了地球如今的结构。整个海洋架都在火山形成的玄武岩之上。

Volcanoes have not only made the continents, they are also thought to have made the world's first stable atmosphere and provoided all the water for the oceans, rivers and ice-caps. There are now about 600 active volcanoes. Every year they add two or three cubic kilometres of rock to the continents. Imagine a similar number of volcanoes smoking away for the last 3,500 million years. That is enough rock to explain the continental crust.

火山不仅造就了大陆，还被认为造就了地球早期的稳定大气环境并提供了海洋、河流、冰层所有的水分。现在，人们认为还有600座火山处于活动状态。每一年他们会将2、3立方米的岩石带到大陆上。想象一下，350万年间，类似数量的火山持续不断地喷发到大陆上。这也解释了大陆地壳那么多石块是从何而来的。

What come out of volcanic craters is mostly gas. More than 90% of this gas is water vapour from the deep earth: enough to explain, over 3,500 million years, the water in the oceans. The rest of the gas is nitrogen, carbon  dioxide, sulphur dioxide, methane, ammonia and hydrogen. The quantity of these gases, again multiplied over 3,500 million years, is enough to explain the mass of the world's atmosphere. We are alive because volcanoes provided the soil ,air and water we need.

Geologists consider the earth as having a molten core, surrounded by a semi-molten mantle and a brittle, outer skin. It helps to think of a soft-boiled  egg with a runny during boiling, the white material bubbles out and sets like a tiny mountain chain over the crack - like an archipelago of volcanic such as the Hawaiian Islands. But the earth is so much bigger and the mantle below is so much hotter.
