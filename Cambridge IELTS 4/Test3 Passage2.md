Volcanoes - earth-shattering news

火山-吸引世界的消息

When Mount Pinatubo suddenly erupted on 9 June 1991, the power of volcanoes past and present again hit the headlines.

当皮纳图博火山突然之间在1991年6月9日喷发的时候，火山带来的巨大威力就时不时地登上报纸头版头条。

Volcanoes are the ultimate earth-moving machinery. A violent eruption can blow the top few kilometres off a mountain, scatter fine ash practically all over over the globe and hurl rock fragments into the stratoshpere to darken the skies a continent away.

火山是地球运动的最强表现。一次强烈的喷发可以让火焰冲到地表以上千米外的高空，扩散的火山灰喷射到几千米之外，那些石头碎片抛向了平流层使得陆地的天空灰蒙蒙一片。

But the classic eruption - cone-shaped mountain, big bang, mushroom cloud and surges of molten lava - is only a tiny part of a global story. Vulcanism, the name given to volcanic process, really has shaped the world. Eurption have rifted continents, raised mountain chains, constructed islands and shaped the topography of the earth. The entire ocean floor has a basement of volcanic basalt.

但是普通的爆发——圆锥体的高山、大爆炸、蘑菇云和剧烈涌出液体岩浆——只不过是世界故事的一部分而已。岩石火成论者，将大自然的形成归功于火山运动的理论，确实造就了大自然的形态。喷发提升了陆地，产生了山脉，创造了岛屿，并形成了地球如今的结构。整个海洋架都在火山形成的玄武岩之上。

Volcanoes have not only made the continents, they are also thought to have made the world's first stable atmosphere and provoided all the water for the oceans, rivers and ice-caps. There are now about 600 active volcanoes. Every year they add two or three cubic kilometres of rock to the continents. Imagine a similar number of volcanoes smoking away for the last 3,500 million years. That is enough rock to explain the continental crust.

火山不仅造就了大陆，还被认为造就了地球早期的稳定大气环境并提供了海洋、河流、冰层所有的水分。现在，人们认为还有600座火山处于活动状态。每一年他们会将2、3立方米的岩石带到大陆上。想象一下，350万年间，类似数量的火山持续不断地喷发到大陆上。这也解释了大陆地壳那么多石块是从何而来的。

What come out of volcanic craters is mostly gas. More than 90% of this gas is water vapour from the deep earth: enough to explain, over 3,500 million years, the water in the oceans. The rest of the gas is nitrogen, carbon  dioxide, sulphur dioxide, methane, ammonia and hydrogen. The quantity of these gases, again multiplied over 3,500 million years, is enough to explain the mass of the world's atmosphere. We are alive because volcanoes provided the soil ,air and water we need.

从火山口中喷出的大部分是气体。多达90%的气体中含有来自地球深层的水蒸气——可以很好的解释，大约在3.5亿年前，这些水组成了海洋。气体的其他部分还有氮气，二氧化碳，二氧化硫，甲烷，氨气和氢气。随着3.5亿年前的反复积累，这些气体的数量足够形成当今地球中的大气。我们能够生存，就是因为火山提供了我们所需要的土壤，空气和水。

Geologists consider the earth as having a molten core, surrounded by a semi-molten mantle and a brittle, outer skin. It helps to think of a soft-boiled  egg with a runny during boiling, the white material bubbles out and sets like a tiny mountain chain over the crack - like an archipelago of volcanic such as the Hawaiian Islands. But the earth is so much bigger and the mantle below is so much hotter. Even though the mantle rocks are kept solid by overlying pressure, they can still slowly 'flow' like thick treacle. The flow, thought to be in the form of convection currents, is powerful enough to fracture the 'eggshell' of the crust into plates, and keep them bumping and grinding against each other, or even overlapping, at the rate of a few centimeters a year. These fracture zones, where the collisions occur, are where earthquakes happen. And, very often, volcanoes.

地理学家认为地球就像一个有一个熔岩的核心，这个核心被半融化状态的表面覆盖，而且这个覆盖物很容易碎。如果把它比作成一个在沸水中煮热的半熟鸡蛋那样就会比较好理解。白色的蛋清从破碎的地方流出，并在裂缝中形成一个类似于山脉一样的形状——就想夏威夷群岛那样的火山岛。但是地球远比鸡蛋要大，而且那些岩浆会更热。尽管这些地幔岩石被上层的压力所控制，但是他们仍然可以像糖浆一样流出。这种流动，被认为是气流形成的一部分，就可以从“蛋壳”里破开，从里面破裂出去流到盘子上，激烈涌出，互相冲击着对方，甚至以每年几厘米的方式覆盖岩石。当碰撞发生时，这些破碎的地带经常会有地震发生。并且，经常还有火山的喷发。

These zones are lines of weakness, or hot spots. Every eruption is different, but put at its simplest, where there are weaknesses, rocks deep in the mantle, heated to 1,350°C, will start to expand and rise. As they do so, the pressure drops, and they expand and become liquid and rise more swiftly.

这些地方都是连片的脆弱地带，或者是热点地区。每次喷发都是不同的，但是简单而言，哪儿脆弱，在地壳里的熔岩当加热到1350°C的时候，就会从底部扩张并上升。当他们这么做之后会让压力下降，于是岩浆继续扩张并液化然后上升的更快。

Sometimes it is slow: vast bubbles of magma - molten rock from the mantle - inch towards the surface, cooling slowly, to show through as granite extrusions (as on Skye, or the Great Whin Sill, the lava dyke squeezed out like toothpaste that carries part of Hadrian's Wall in northern England]. Sometimes - as in Northern Ireland, Wales and the Karoo in South Africa - the magma rose faster, and then flowed out horizontally on to the surface in vast thick sheets. In the Deccan plateau in western India, there are more than two million cubic kilometers of lava, some of it 2,400 metes thick, formed over 500,000 years of slurping eruption.

Sometimes the magma moves very swiftly indeed. It does not have time to cool as it surges upwards. The gases trapped inside the boiling rock expand suddenly, the lava glows with heat, it begins to froth, and it explodes with tremendous force. Then the slightly cooler lava following it begins to flow over the lip of the crater. It happens on Mars, it happened on the moon, it even happens on some of the moons of Jupiter and Uranus. By studying the evidence, vulcanologists can read the force of the great blasts of the past. Is the pumice light and full of holes? The explosion was tremendous. Are the rocks heavy, with huge crystalline basalt shapes, like the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland? It was a slow, gentle eruption.
