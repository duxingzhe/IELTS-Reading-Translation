Obtaining Linguistic Data

获取双语信息

Many procedures are available for obtaining data about a language. They range from a carefully planned, intensive field investigation in a foreign country to a casual introspection about one's mother tongue carried out in an armchair at home. 

通过一门语言来获得信息的流程有很多种。从在外国进行仔细计划安排、详尽的调查到家里坐在摇椅上母亲絮絮叨叨的言语，都是这个过程的体现。

In all cases, someone has to act as a source of language data — an informant. Informants are (ideally) native speakers of a language, who provide utterances for analysis and other kinds of information about the language (e.g. translations, comments about correctness, or judgments on usage). Often, when studying their mother tongue, linguists act as their own informants, judging the ambiguity, acceptability, or other properties of utterances against their own intuitions. The convenience of this approach makes it widely used, and it is considered the norm in the generative approach to linguistics. But a linguist’s personal judgments are often uncertain, or disagree with the judgments of other linguists, at which point recourse is needed to more objective methods of enquiry, using non-linguists as informants. The latter procedure is unavoidable when working on foreign languages, or child speech. 

在所有的情况当中，有一些人充当着语言信息的源头，称之为信息提供者。信息提供者（理想情况下）一般为一种语言的母语使用者，他一般做为语言提供分析和其他有关的说话方式（比如像翻译，修正的评论，或者是使用的判断）。通常情况下，当他们使用自己的母语时，双语学习者自己会成为信息提供者，分析双关语、可行性和其他与自身认识相冲突的使用方式。正因为他比较方便，所以它被广泛使用。而且它被认为是对双语学习者有生产力的一种标准方式。但是，以为双语学习者的方式并非是准确的，或者并不认同其他双语学习者的观点。参考其他双语学习者的观点需要更加可观的检索方式，还要使用非双语学习者做为信息提供者。后者在学习外语和牙牙学语的时候都需要经历。

Many factors must be considered when selecting informants — whether one is working with single speakers (a common situation when languages have not been described before), two people interacting, small groups or large-scale samples. Age, sex, social background and other aspects of identity are important, as these factors are known to influence the kind of language used. The topic of conversation and the characteristics of the social setting (e.g. the level of formality) are also highly relevant, as are the personal qualities of the informants (e.g. their fluency and consistency). For larger studies, scrupulous attention has been paid to the sampling theory employed, and in all cases, decisions have to be made about the best investigative techniques to use.

许多因素都要在选择语言提供者的时候进行参考——是否是只会一种语言的人（通常情况下，可能是这些语言都不是平时能接触到的），两个人的交流方式，小范围还是大群。年龄，性别，社会背景和身份的其他方面都需要考虑，因为这些背景都会影响到语言的使用。对话的主题和社会地位设定的特征（比如，正式程度）都是强联系，体现了语言提供者的个人质量（比如，他们的流利程度和持久性）。为了有更多的研究，提供使用的例子时需要仔细的观察，并且在所有的情况下，结论应该基于最好的调查方法之上。

Today, researchers often tape-record informants. This enables the linguist’s claims about the language to be checked, and provides a way of making those claims more accurate (‘difficult’pieces of speech can be listened to repeatedly). But obtaining naturalistic, good-quality data is never easy. People talk abnormally when they know they are being recorded, and sound quality can be poor. A variety of tape-recording procedures have thus been devised to minimize the ‘observer’s paradox’ (how to observe the way people behave when they are not being observed). Some recordings are made without the speakers being aware of the fact — a procedure that obtains very natural data, though ethical objections must be anticipated. Alternatively, attempts can be made to make the speaker forget about the recording, such as keeping the tape recorder out of sight, or using radio microphones. A useful technique is to introduce a topic that quickly involves the speaker, and stimulates a natural language style (e.g. asking older informants about how times have changed in their locality).

An audio tape recording does not solve all the linguist's problems, however. Speech is often   unclear and ambiguous. Where possible , therefore, the recording has to be supplemented by the observer's written comments on the non-verbal behaviour of the participants, and about the context in general. A facial expression, for example, can dramatically alter the meaning of what is said. Video recordings avoid these problems to a large extent, but even they have limitations(the camera connot be everywhere), and transcriptions always benefit from any additional commentary provided by an observer.
